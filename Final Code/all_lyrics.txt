operator please connect me 
with 1982
i need to make apologies 
for what i didn't do 
i sure do need to tell her 
that i've thought the whole thing through
and now it's clear that she is what 
i should have held on to
they say hindsight's 2020 
but i'm nearly going blind
from staring at her photograph 
and wishing she was mine
it's that same old lost love story
it's sad but it's true
there was a time when she was mine 
in 1982
postman can you sell me 
a special kind of stamp
one to send a letter from 
this crazy lonely man
back into the wasted years 
of my living past
i need to tell her now i know 
how long my love will last
they say hindsight's 2020 
but i'm nearly going blind
from staring at her photograph 
and wishing she was mine
it's that same old lost love story
it's sad but it's true
there was a time when she was mine 
in 1982
losing my mind going back in time 
to 1982 

tumble out of bed
and stumble to the kitchen
pour myself a cup of ambition
and yawn and stretch and try to come to life
jump in the shower
and the blood starts pumpin'
out on the streets
the traffic starts jumpin'
for folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

workin' 9 to 5
what a way to make a livin'
barely gettin' by
it's all takin'
and no givin'
they just use your mind
and they never give you credit
it's enough to drive you
crazy if you let it
9 to 5 for service and devotion
you would think that i
would deserve a fat promotion
want to move ahead
but the boss won't seem to let me 
i swear sometimes that man is out to get me
mmmmm
they let you dream
just a' watch 'em shatter
you're just a step
on the boss man's ladder
but you got dreams he'll never take away
in the same boat
with a lot of your friends
waitin' for the day
your ship'll come in
and the tide's gonna turn
an' it's all gonna roll you away
workin' 9 to 5
what a way to make livin'
barely gettin' by
it's all takin'
and no givin'
they just use your mind
and you never get the credit
it's enough to drive you
crazy if you let it
9 to 5 yeah they got you were they want you
there's a better life
and you think about it don't you
it's a rich man's game
no matter what they call it
and you spend your life
putting money in his wallet
9 to 5
oh what a way to make a livin'
barely gettin' by
it's all takin'
and no givin'
they just use your mind
and they never give you credit
it's enough to drive you
crazy if you let it
fade
9 to 5 yeah they got you where they want you
there's a better life
and you dream about it don't you
it's a rich man's game
no matter what they call it
and you spend your life
putting money in his wallet
9 to 5

i've been bound to leave you 
we've known that for awhile
i'm sure it's something i can't do 
if i can't leave you with a smile
i don't know how far i'll have to go 
'til i'm sure those eyes won't cry
and in my mind i've left enough to know 
that i can't leave you
with a bad goodbye
goodbye easier said than done
goodbye there's no good when you're the one
whose goodbye you swore would never come
and in my goodbye you're finding none
i'm still bound to leave you 
i surely don't know how
my heart won't let me put you through
what my mind says should happen now
i don't know where we'll go from here 
there may be no way to fly
and the cloud i'm in just makes it 
all too clear that i can't leave you
with a bad goodbye
goodbye easier said than done
goodbye there's no good when you're the one
whose goodbye you swore would never come
and in my goodbye you're finding none
how can we be so far between 
where we are and one more try
and any way i look 
i've only seen that i can't leave you
with a bad goodbye

what do you say when it's over 
i don't know if i should say anything at all 
one day we're rollin' in the clover 
next thing you know we take the fall 
still i think about the years since i first met you 
and the way it might have been without you here 
and i don't know if words from me can still upset you 
but i've just gotta make this memory stand clear 
i know i'm leavin' here a better man 
for knowin' you this way 
things i couldn't do before now i think i can 
and i'm leavin here a better man
i guess i always knew i couldn't hold you
but i'd never be the one to set you free 
just like some old nursery rhyme your mama told you 
you still believe in some old meanttobe 
 
still i'm leavin' here a better man 
 
well my daddy left home when i was three
and he didn't leave much to ma and me
just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze
now i don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
but the meanest thing that he ever did
was before he left he went and named me sue
well he musta thought that it was quite a joke
an' it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks
seems i had to fight my whole life through
some gal would giggle and i'd get red
and some guy'd laugh and i'd bust his head
i'll tell ya life ain't easy for a boy named sue
well i grew up quick and i grew up mean
my fist got hard and my wits got keen
i roamed from town to town to hide my shame
but i made me a vow to the moon and stars
i'd search the honkytonks and bars
and kill that man that gave me that awful name
well it was gatlinburg in midjuly
and i'd just hit town and my throat was dry
i thought i'd stop and have myself a brew
in an old saloon on a street of mud
there at a table dealin' stud
sat the dirty mangy dog that named me sue
well i knew that snake was my own sweet dad
from a worn out picture that my mother had
and i knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
he was big and bent and grey and old
and i looked at him and my blood ran cold and i said
my name is sue how do you do now you gonna die
yeah that's what i told him
well i hit him hard right between the eyes
and he went down but to my surprise
came up with a knife an' cut off a piece o' my ear
i busted a chair right across his teeth
and we crashed through the wall and into the street
kickin' and a gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer
i tell ya i've fought tougher men
but i really can't remember when
he kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
well i heard him laugh and then i heard him cuss
he went for his gun but i pulled mine first
he stood there lookin' at me and i saw him smile
and he said son this world is rough
and if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
and i know i wouldn't be there to help you along
so i gave you that name and i said goodbye
i knew you'd have to get tough or die
and it's that name that helped to make you strong
yeah he said now you just fought one hell of a fight
and i know you hate me and ya got the right
to kill me now and i wouldn't blame you if you do
but you oughta thank me before i die
for the gravel in your gut and the spit in the eye
'cause i'm the sonofabitch that named you sue
yeah what could i do what could i do
i got all choked up and threw down my gun
called him my pa and he called me his son
and i came away with a different point of view
and i think about him now and then
every time i try and every time i win
and if i ever have a son i think i'm gonna name him
bill or george anything but sue i still hate that name 

i don't need a whole lot of money
but i wouldn't turn a lottery down
i just need a little green in my pocket
so i can buy my buddies a round
all i want is a place to lay my head with the woman i love lyin' in my bed
kind of understated
my dreams aren't that complicatedÖ
i wanna be the one
when all is said and done
who lived a good life loved a good wife and always helped someone in trouble
on the day they lay me down
i want everyone to gather ëround
and say he was a father brother neighbour and a friend
he was a good man
i used to dream of being a rock star
and seein' the world in style
used to dream of havin' a fast car
and driving that miracle mile
but i've heard tales those streets aren't paved in gold
they're full of pot holes and empty souls
who never learnÖ
love is something you gotta earn
i wanna be the one
when all is said and done
who lived a good life loved a good wife and always helped someone in trouble
on the day they lay me down
want everyone to gather ëround
and say he was a father brother neighbour and a friend
he was a good man
when i'm gone i wanna leave a legacy
of love and laughs and honesty behind me
behind meÖ
i wanna be the one
when all is said and done
who lived a good life loved a good wife and always helped someone in trouble
on the day they lay me down
want everyone to gather ëround
and say he was a father brother neighbour and a friend
he was a good manÖ
yaaaaaÖi wanna be a good manÖa father a brother a neighbour and a friend
i wanna be a good man 
a high roller even when the chips are down 
to win her over i'd seen the tables turn around 
she's ten the hard way i can feel it in my bones 
she'll be makin' my day and not another night alone 
'til it's time for a windfall and not a single minute too soon 
i've been too long overdue now i'm gonna shoot the moon
i'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck 
seven come eleven and she could be mine 
luck be a lady and i'm gonna find love comin' on the bottom line 
i've been to the table and i've lost it all before 
i'm willin' and able always comin' back for more 
squeezin' out a thin dime 'til there's no one hanging on my arm 
i've gambled on a third time a fool will tell you it's a charm 
if i'm bettin' on a loser i'm gonna have a devil to pay 
but it's the only game i know to play it doesn't matter anyway 
i'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck 
seven come eleven and she could be mine 
luck be a lady and i'm gonna find love comin' on the bottom line
i'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck 
seven come eleven and she could be mine 
luck be a lady and i'm gonna find love comin' on the bottom line

a white sport coat and a pink carnation 
i'm all dressed up for the dance 
a white sport coat and a pink carnation 
i'm all alone in romance

once you told me long ago to the prom with me 
you'd go now you've changed your mind 
it seems someone else will hold my dreams 
a white sport coat and a pink carnation i'm in a blue blue mood 
back to bridge 


by alan jackson
i have felt it
and i have held it
i have known
a woman's love 
i have tasted
and i have wasted
a woman's love
and i know
i'll never understand 
all the little things
that make it grand 
a woman's love
and i know
i'll never come face to face 
with any thing
that takes the place 
of a woman's love
well i have kiss it
tried to resist it 
i have missed
a woman's love
and i have hated
taken for granted
a woman's love
well i have needed
and i have pleaded 
and i have lost
a woman's love 
and i have worshipped
and i have cursed it
a woman's love
well i adore it
thank god for it
a woman's love 
lately i've been lookin' through the windows of my soul
and i can see there's not much left to hold
just an empty space surrounded by the pieces of
a badly broken heart that's forgotten how to love
what my heart needs is a woman's touch
a tender hand to fix it up
its rough and ragged edges sure could use some love
what my heart needs is a woman's touch
when i look in the mirror the only thing i see
are traces of the man i used to be
late at night i hear it it cannot be denied
a lonely voice is crying out from somewhere deep inside
what my heart needs is a woman's touch
a tender hand to fix it up
its rough and ragged edges sure could use some love
what my heart needs is a woman's touch
what my heart needs is a woman's touch
a tender hand to fix it up
its rough and ragged edges sure could use some love
what my heart needs is a woman's touch
yeah its rough and ragged edges
sure could sure some love
what my heart needs is a woman's touch
what my poor heart needs is a woman's touch
a woman's touch 
you can tell the world you never was my girl
you can burn my clothes when i'm gone
oh you can tell your friends just what a fool i've been 
and laugh and joke about me on the phone
you can tell my arms go back onto the farm
you can tell my feet to hit the floor
or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips 
they won't be reaching out for you no more
but don't tell my heart my achy breaky heart
i just don't think it'd understand
and if you tell my heart my achy breaky heart
he might blow up and kill this man
ooh
you can tell your ma i moved to arkansas
you can tell your dog to bite my leg
or tell your brother cliff his fist can tell my lip
he never really liked me anyway
or tell your aunt louise tell anything you please
myself already knows i'm not okay
or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind 
it might be walking out on me one day
but don't tell my heart my achy breaky heart
i just don't think it'd understand
and if you kill my heart my achy breaky heart
he might blow up and kill this man

'til the sun comes up
six o'clock on friday evening
momma doesn' t know she's leaving
'til she hears the screen door slamming
rubber squealin' gears ajamming
local country station just a blaring on the radio
pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo
momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warning
girl you better get your red head
back in bed before the morning
nine o'clock the show is ending
but the fun is just beginning
she knows he's anticipating
but she's gonna keep him waiting
grab a bite to eat
and then they're heading to the honkey tonk
but loud crowds and line dancing
just ain't what they really want
drive out to the boondocks and park down by the creek
and where it's george strait 'til real late
and dancing cheek to cheek

ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
going 'round the world in a pickup truck
ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
ten 'til twelve is wine and dancing
midnight starts the hard romancing
one o'clock that truck is rocking
two is coming still no stopping
break to check the clock at three
they're right on where they want to be
four o'clock get up and going
five o'clock that rooster's crowing

six o'clock on saturday
her folks don't know he's on his way
the stalls are clean the horses fed
they say she's grounded 'til she's dead
well here he comes around the bend
slowing down she's jumping in
hey mom you're daughter's gone
and there they go again

i like kickin' back on the sofa
flippin' through the channels just to see what's on
i enjoy eatin' eggs over easy 
soppin' up with a biscuit 'til the yellow's gone

ain't nothin' like watchin' a bunch of young'ns
run screamin' through the sprinkler in their little bare feet
and ain't nothin' like finding twenty dollars 
in the pocket of the britches that you wore last week
i get into getting out on my mower
in the early mornin' hours 'fore the sun gets hot
and i like goin' down to the kroger 
when the carnival comes to the parkin' lot
2nd 
ain't nothin' like throwin a hula popper
draggin' it across a spot a big 'un oughta be
and ain't nothin like having him for supper
with some good hush puppies and some sweet iced tea
bridge
this old world holds all kind of treasures 
and every day it just keeps gettin' better
3rd 
ain't nothin like finding that woman
that you know you're gonna love for the rest of your life
and ain't nothin' like knowing the lord's a comin'
back one day to make you want to do right
repeat 1st 
repeat 2nd  
you keep calling me on the telephone
you say you're all alone well that's real sad
and you keep leavin' notes stuck on my door

'cause i ain't that lonely yet
no i ain't that lonely yet
after what you put me through
oh i ain't that lonely yet
  
once there was this spider in my bed
i got caught up in her web of love and lies
she spun her chains around my heart and soul
never to let go oh but i survived
'cause i ain't that lonely yet
no i ain't that lonely yet
after what you put me through
oh i ain't that lonely yet
there's nothing left that you can do 
to try and bring me around
'cause everything you do just brings me down
oh well i ain't that lonely yet
no i ain't that lonely yet
after what you put me through

little old joint outside of town
i only got time for a couple of beers and 
a juke box song ringing in my ears
the next you know the bar tenders pouring shots are flowing got me stonin'
all i really know is that i should be going 
but i'm soaking up the moment

one thing i've learned when you get tore up
time sure flies when you're all jacked up
it was getting mighty close to nine o'clock 
what the hell i have one more shot
then i winked at a boy at the end of the bar 
guess i mighta musta gone a little too far
cause a big ole girl walked outta the blue 
10 foot 2 with a bad attitude
stepped right up and knocked out my tooth 
guess i had it coming i deserved the due
cos i was all jacked up all jacked up
don't believe i've ever had this much
one thing i've learned when you get tore up
don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up
don't have to go home but you can't stay here 
that's what they said when i got my last beer
oh my god its 2 o'clock i can't find my keys and my trucks locked
so i grabbed a tire tool and i broke my window 
hurt my elbow got me in though
two foot later backed into the light pole 
all the town folk got a good show

draw emotion like a knife draws blood
in the arms of the one your're dreaming of
all you really wanna do is to fall in love
don't want to feel so blue 

since the day they got married
he'd been praying for a little baby boy
someone he could take fishing
throw the football and be his pride and joy
he could already see him holding that trophy
taking his team to state
but when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
all those big dreams changed and
now he's wrapped around her finger
she's the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little 
beautiful wonderful perfect allamerican girl
sixteen short years later
she was falling for the senior football star
before you knew it he was dropping passes
skipping practice just to spend more time with her
the coach said hey son what's your problem 
tell me have you lost your mind 
daddy said you'll lose your free ride to college
boy you better tell her goodbye but
now he's wrapped around her finger
she's the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little 
beautiful wonderful perfect allamerican
and when they got married and decided to have one of their own
she said be honest tell me what you want 
and he said honey you oughta know 
sweet little beautiful one just like you 
oh a beautiful wonderful perfect allamerican
now he's wrapped around her finger
she's the center of his whole world
and his heart belongs to that sweet little 
beautiful wonderful perfect allamerican girl 
oh american girl 
there was rain on the street last night 
we stood beneath the front door light 
and everything we said we made sure the neighbors heard 
you called me this i called you that 
standing on the welcome mat 
everything we felt it all came down to just one word 
but you couldn't say it and i couldn't say it 
 
you know i tried my best to go 
i know you cried 'cause i hurt you so 
it should have been easy to say that we were through 
but to walk away from love was more than we could do 
it was almost goodbye 
almost goodbye 
now there was sun through the blinds this morning 
when i opened up my eyes 
outside i could hear a mockingbird 
and i could feel your heartbeat as you layed there by my side 
i thought of how the world could end with just one word 
but you didn't say it and i didn't say it 
 
sometimes the most important words are the ones that you leave unspoken 
you know i tried my best to go 
and i know you cried 'cause i hurt you so 
it should have been easy to say that we were through 
but to walk away from love that way was more than we could do 
it was almost goodbye 
almost goodbye no i couldn't say it was 
almost goodbye oh oh 
almost goodbye 

my mama mapped out the road she knows
which hands you shake which hands you hold
and my handmedown mercury ready to roll
she knew that i had to go
and hang out make lots of noise
and lay out late with a boy
making mistakes that she made cause she knew all along
i was already gone
i was already gone
i was already gone
life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on
they say the first time won't ever last
but that didn't stop me the first time he laughed
all my friends tried to warn me the day that we met
girl don't you lose your heart yet
but his dark eyes dared me with danger
and sparks flied like flame to a paper
fire in his touch burning me up
but still i held on
cause i was already gone
i was already gone
i was already gone
life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on
last time i saw we packed up my things
and he smiled like the first time he told me his name
and we cried with eachother
we split the blame for the parts that we couldn't change
pictures dishes and socks
it's our whole life down to one box
there he was waving goodbye on the front porch alone
but i was already gone
i was already gone
i was already gone
i was already gone
i was already gone
hang out make lots of noise
and lay out late with a boy
making mistakes that she made
life is a runaway train

my little girl met a new friend
just the other day
on the playground at school
between the tires and the swings
but she came home with tearfilled eyes
and she said to me daddy alyssa lies
i just brushed it off at first
cause i didn't know how much my little girl had been hurt
or the things she had seen
i wasn't ready when i said you can tell me
and she said

alyssa lies
to the classroom
alyssa lies 
everyday at school
alyssa lies
to the teacher
as she tries to cover every bruise
my little girl laid her head down
that night to go to sleep
as i stepped out the room i heard her say
a prayer so soft and sweet
god bless my mom and my dad
and my new friend alyssa
i know she needs it bad

i had the worst night of sleep in years
as i tried to think of a way to calm her fears
i knew just what it was i had to do
but when we got to school on monday i heard the news
my little girl asked me why everybody looked so sad
the lump in my throat grew bigger
with every question that she asked
until i felt the tears run down my face
and i told her that alyssa wouldn't be at school today
she doesn't lie
in the classroom
she doesn't lie
anymore at school
alyssa lies
with jesus
because there's nothing anyone would do
tears filled my eyes
when my little girl asked me why
alyssa lies
daddy tell me why
alyssa lies 

he gets up before the dawn
packs a lunch an' a thermos full of coffee
it's another day in the dusty haze
those burnin' rays are wearin' down his body
the diesels worth the price of gold
it's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
but he's still holdin' on
he just takes the tractor another round
an' pulls the plow across the ground
and sends up another prayer
he says lord i never complain i never ask 'why'
please don't let my dreams run dry
underneath underneath this amarillo sky
that hail storm back in '83
sure did take a toll on his family
but he stayed strong and carried on
just like his dad and granddad did before him
on his knees every night
he prays please let my crops and children grow
'cause that's all he's ever known
he just takes the tractor another round
an' pulls the plow across the ground
and sends up another prayer
he says lord i never complain i never ask 'why'
please don't let my dreams run dry
underneath underneath this amarillo sky

an' he takes the tractor another round another round
another round another round
another round
an' he takes the tractor another round another round
he says i never complain i never ask 'why'
please don't let my dreams run dry
underneath underneath this amarillo sky
underneath this amarillo sky 
every time our eyes meet
this feelin' inside me
is almost more than i can take
baby when you touch me
i can feel how much you love me
and it just blows me away
i've never been this close to anyone or anything
i can hear your thoughts
i can see your dreams

verse 1
i've walked a million miles across this floor
but i never have quite made it to the door
i never thought the time would come
i'd ever see this day
when you could make me feel so thrown away

i'm feeling like an old pair of shoes
all worn out from walking through these blues
there's a hole in my soul
and i'm really feeling used
i'm just like an old pair of shoes
verse 2
you've always been my one and only love
it ain't no easy thing to give you up
looking back i'm feeling like
there's nothing left to lose
this time i may just walk out on you cause

tagg
there's a hole in my soul
and i'm really feeling used
i'm just like an old pair of shoes 

thousands of people 
live in this town 
and i had to run into him 
when i saw him there 
on that busy street 
those feelings came back again 
there was no where to run 
no where to hide 
he walked up to me 
looked in my eyes 
and still 
the world stood still 
i couldn't move 
and all i could feel 
was this aching in my heart 
saying i loved him 
still 
he said how've you been 
it's great to see you again 
you're really a sight for sore eyes 
i said i can't complain 
oh i'm doin' fine 
we talked 
as the people rushed by 
we laughed about old times 
and all we went through 
that's when he hugged me 
and said i've missed you 
and still 
the world stood still 
i couldn't move 
and all i could feel 
was this aching in my heart 
saying i loved him 
still 
that's when she walked up to him 
he said this is my wife 
i gave my best smile 
but i was dying inside 
he said we gotta go now 
it's getting late 
it was so good to see you 
and then they walked away 
and still 
my world stood still 
i couldn't move 
and all i could feel 
was this aching in my heart 
saying i loved him 
still 

you had not've fallen then i would not've found you
angel flying too close to the ground
and i patched up your broken wing and hung around awhile
trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down
i knew someday that you would fly away for love's the greatest healer to be found
so leave me if you need to i will still remember angel flying too close to the ground
 guitar 
fly on fly on past the speed of sound i'd rather see you up than see you down
so leave me if you need to i will still remember angel flying too close to the ground
so leave me if you need to i will still remember angel flying too close to the ground 
there'll be no strings to bind your hands
not if my love can't bind your heart
and there's no need to take a stand
for it was i who chose to start
i see no need to take me home
i'm old enough to face the dawn
just call me angel of the morning angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me baby
just call me angel of the morning angel
then slowly turn away from me
maybe the sun's light will be dim
and it won't matter anyhow
if morning's echo says we've sinned
well it was what i wanted now
and if we're victims of the night
i won't be blinded by the light
just call me angel of the morning angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me baby
just call me angel of the morning angel
then slowly turn away
i won't beg you to stay with me
through the tears of the day
of the years baby baby baby
just call me angel of the morning angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me baby
just call me angel of the morning angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me darling
just call me angel of the morning angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me darling 
i was walking home from school on a cold winter day 
took a shortcut through the woods and i lost my way 
it was getting late and i was scared and alone 
but then a kind old man took my hand and led me home 
mama couldn't see him oh but he was standing there 
and i knew in my heart he was the answer to my prayers 
 
oh i believe there are angels among us 
sent down to us from somewhere up above 
they come to you and me in our darkest hours 
to show us how to live to teach us how to give 
to guide us with the light of love 
when life held troubled times and had me down on my knees 
there's always been someone to come along and comfort me 
a kind word from a stranger to lend a helping hand 
a phone call from a friend just to say i understand 
and ain't it kind of funny at the dark end of the road 
that someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope 
 
they wear so many faces show up in the strangest places 
to grace us with their mercy in our time of need 
 
to guide us with a light of love 
you fill up my senses

you can spend your whole life building something from nothing
one storm can come and blow it all away
build it anyway
you can chase a dream that seems so out of reach and you know it might not ever come your way
dream it anyway
 
god is great but sometimes life ain't good
and when i pray it doesn't always turn out like i think it should
but i do it anyway i do it anyway
this world's gone crazy and it's hard to believe that tomorrow will be better than today
believe it anyway
you can love someone with all your heart for all the right reasons and in a moment they can choose to walk away
love 'em anyway

you can pour your soul out singing a song you believe in that tomorrow they'll forget you ever sang
sing it anyway sing it anyway
i sing i dream i love anyway 


i never thought that this is where i'd settle down 
i thought i'd die an old man back in my hometown 
they gave me this plot of land 
me and some other men for a job well done 
there's a big white house sits on a hill just up the road 
the man inside he cried the day they brought me home 
they folded up a flag and told my mom and dad 
we're proud of your son 
and i'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property 
i'm on sacred ground and i'm in the best of company 
i'm thankful for those thankful for the things i've done 
i can rest in peace 
i'm one of the chosen ones 
i made it to arlington 
i remember daddy brought me here when i was eight 
we searched all day to find out where my granddad lay 
and when we finally found that cross 
he said son this is what it cost to keep us free 
now here i am a thousand stones away from him 
he recognized me on the first day i came in 
and it gave me a chill when he clicked his heels 
and saluted me 
and i'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property 
i'm on sacred ground and i'm in the best of company 
i'm thankful for those thankful for the things i've done 
i can rest in peace 
i'm one of the chosen ones 
i made it to arlington 
and everytime i hear twentyone guns 
i know they brought another hero home to us 
we're thankful for those thankful for the things we've done 
we can rest in peace 
'cause we are the chosen ones 
we made it to arlington 
yeah dust to dust 
don't cry for us 
we made it to arlington 
lately she's been pickin' fights
droppin' hints and just last night
i caught a tear as she slipped off to sleep 
she's not here but she's not gone
i guess she must be waitin' on
the kind of man i promised her i'd be

as any fool can see
she's gonna cross that line
she's got leavin' on her mind
and its too late but what keeps killin' me
is knowin' i've been blind 
as any fool can see
how long did i think she'd stand
for me to be the kind of man
that came and went just as i dang well pleased 
while she sits at home alone
with fears and feelings of her own
lord knows goodbye would bring me to my knees
 3x 
toby keithscotty emerick
she said i seen you in here before
i said i been here a time or two
she said hello my name is bobby jo

i've known him since we were kids at school

one great big fat biker man
i heard david yell across the room
hey buddy how 'bout a helpin' handi said dave
i ain't as good as i once was
my how the years have flown
but there was a time back in my prime
when i could really hold my own
if you want to fight tonight
guess them boys don't look all that tough
i ain't as good as i once was but i'm as good once
as i ever was
i used to be hell on wheels 
back when i was a younger man
now my body says you can't do this boy 
but my pride says oh yes you can
i ain't as good as i once was
that's just the cold hard truth
i still throw a few back talk a little smack
when i'm feelin' bullet proof
so don't doubledog dare me now
'cause i might have to call your bluff
i ain't as good as i once was but i'm as good once
as i ever was
i ain't as good as i once was but i'm as good once
as i ever was

there's a storm across the valley
clouds are rolling in
the afternoon lies heavy
on your shoulders
there's a truck out on the four lane
a mile or more away
and the whining of his wheels
just makes it colder
he's an hour away from riding
on his prayers up in the sky
and ten days on the road
are barely gone
like a fire softly burning
supper's on the stove
it's the light in your eyes
that keeps him warm

hey it's good to be back home again
sometimes this old farm
feels like a long lost friend
yes and hey it's good to be back home again
there's all the news to tell him
how you've spent your time
and what's the latest thing the neighbors say
and your mother called last friday
sunshine made her cry
and you felt the baby move just yesterday
 then
bridge
and all the time that i can lay this tired old body down
to feel your fingers feather soft upon me
the kisses that i live for 
the love that lights my way
the happiness that living with you brings me
it's the sweetest thing i know of
just spending time with you
it's the little things that make a house a home
like a fire softly burning supper's on the stove
and it's the light in your eyes that makes me warm
 then
tag
i said hey it's good to be back home again 
i'm back in the saddle again

i used to do ya like this do ya like that 
this way thata way anyway but the right way 
was ok baby 
oh i guess you had to leave before i could see 
that you're the only one with everything i need 
but you won't even call me you won't even talk to me 
come on and talk to me 
 
oh baby if i could be back in your arms again 
tell you all the things i should have said back then 
i wanna let you know just how wrong i've been 
oh how wrong i've been 
oh honey you know if i could just hold you one more time 
tell you all the things that i got on my mind 
how could this grown girl be so blind 
how could i be so blind 
you used to do me so good do me so right 
every time i need you in the middle of the night 
you'd be right there baby 
oh i never thought i'd wake up and you'd be gone 
if you can find it in your heart to come back home 
honey if you'd let me i could make it up to you 
i'll make it up to you 
 
i was havin' me a good time 
givin' you a bad line 
every time i got home 
but now i'm goin insane 
i thought i had a good thing 
my good things good as gone 
 twice 
at the ripe old age of nineteen
i bought a short bed pick up chicks machine
life ran on beer and gasoline
a half a lap ahead of the law
i had a fake i d that got me into tuffies
love was a word i used to get lucky
was a big time spender with that plastic money
back when i knew it all
back when the world was flat and
mama and daddy didn't have a clue
that was back
back when a pitcher of beer and a
couple shots made me bulletproof
back when god was a name i used in vain
to get a point across when i got ticked off
lord i'm learning so much more than
back when i knew it all
i found out credit cards don't mean you're rich
and beer and gasoline don't mix
yeah step side trucks can't jump a ditch
and those big house rooms sure are small
i've learned that love is a woman that will settle you down
a sunday sermon can turn life around
man i can't believe all the answers i've found
since back when i knew it all
back when the world was flat and
mama and daddy didn't have a clue
that was back
back when a pitcher of beer and a
couple shots made me bulletproof
back when god was a name i used in vain
to get a point across when i got ticked off
lord i'm learning so much more than
back when i knew it all
i've done some growing up
and i'm still growing up
so i know i'll never be
as smart as i once was
that was back
back when the world was flat and
mama and daddy didn't have a clue
that was back
back when a pitcher of beer and a
couple shots made me bulletproof
back when god was a name i used in vain
to get a point across when i got ticked off
lord i'm learning so much more than
back when i knew it all

it was labor day weekend i was seventeen
i bought a coke and some gasoline
and i drove out to the county fair
when i saw her for the first time
she was standing there in the ticket line
and it all started right then and there
oh a sailor sky made a perfect sunset
and that's the day i'll never forget
i had a barbeque stain on my white tshirt
she was killing me in that miniskirt
skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
she had a suntan line and red lipstick
i worked so hard for that first kiss
and a heart don't forget something like that
well it was five years later on a southbound plane
i was headed down to new orleans
to meet some friends of mine for the mardi gras
when i heard a voice from the past
comin' from a few rows back
and when i looked i couldn't believe just what i saw
she said i bet you don't remember me
and i said only every other memory
i had a barbeque stain on my white tshirt
you were killing me in that miniskirt
skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
you had a suntan line and red lipstick
i worked so hard for that first kiss
and a heart don't forget something like that
like an old photograph
time can make a feeling fade
but the memory of a first love
never fades away
i had a barbeque stain on my white tshirt
she was killing me in that miniskirt
skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
she had a sun tan line and red lipstick
i worked so hard for that first kiss
a heart don't forget no a heart don't forget
i said a heart don't forget something like that
oh not something like that 




i will not make the same mistakes that you did
i will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
i will not break the way you did
you fell so hard
i've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side
so i don't get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust
not only me but everyone around me
because of you
i am afraid
i lose my way
and it's not too long before you point it out
i cannot cry
because i know that's weakness in your eyes
i'm forced to fake a smile a laugh
every day of my life
my heart can't possibly break
when it wasn't even whole to start with
because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side
so i don't get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust
not only me but everyone around me
because of you
i am afraid
i watched you die
i heard you cry
every night in your sleep
i was so young
you should have known better than to lean on me
you never thought of anyone else
you just saw your pain
and now i cry
in the middle of the night
for the same damn thing
because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side
so i don't get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust
not only me but everyone around me
because of you
i am afraid
because of you
because of you 
well a man come on the 6 o'clock news

starin' out into the wild blue yonder
so many thoughts to sit and ponder
'bout life and love and lack of 
and this emptiness in my heart
too old to be wild and free still
too young to be over the hill

but who knows where to start
so i just sit right here and have another beer in mexico
do my best to waste another day
sit right here and have another beer in mexico
let the warm air melt these blues away
sun comes up and sun sinks down 
and i seen 'em both in this tourist town

from the answers and the reasons why 
i'm at these crossroads in my life
and i really don't know 
which way to go
so i just sit right here and have another beer in mexico
do my best to waste another day
sit right here and have another beer in mexico

or stay single and stay free
which road i travel is
still a mystery to me
so i'll just sit right here have another beer in mexico
do my best to waste another day
sit right here and have another beer in mexico
let the warm air melt these blues away
down in mexico 


right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleached blonde tramp and she's probably getting frisky
right now he's probably buying her some fruity little drink ëcause she can't shoot whiskey
right now he's probably up behind her with a pool stick showing her how to shoot a combo
and he don't know
 i dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive
carved my name into his leather seats
i took a louisville slugger to both headlights
slashed a hole in all four tires
maybe next time he'll think before he cheats 
right now she's probably up singing some white trash version of shania karaoke
right now she's probably saying i'm drunk and he's athinking that he's gonna get lucky
right now he's probably dabbing on three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
oh and he don't know
 that i dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive
carved my name into his leather seats
i took a louisville slugger to both headlights
i slashed a hole in all four tires
maybe next time he'll think before he cheats 
 i might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
ëcause the next time that he cheats oh you know it won't be on me
no not on me 
' cause i dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive
carved my name into his leather seats
i took a louisville slugger to both headlights
slashed a hole in all four tires
maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
oh maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
oh before he cheats
oh  
if he brings you happiness
then i wish you all the best
it's your happiness that matters most of all
but if he ever breaks your heart
if the teardrops ever start
i'll be there before the next teardrop falls
si te quiere de verdad
y te da felicidad
te deseo lo mas bueno pa'los dos
pero si te hace llorar
a mi me puedes hablar
y estare contigo cuando triste estas
i'll be there anytime
you need me by your side
to drive away every teardrop that you cried
and if he ever leaves you blue
just remember i love you
and i'll be there before the next teardrop falls
and i'll be there before the next teardrop falls 

my baby makes me proud
lord don't she make me proud
she never makes a scene
by hangin' all over me in a crowd
'cause people like to talk
lord don't they love to talk
but when they turn out the lights
i know she'll be leavin' with me
and when we get behind closed doors
then she lets her hair hang down
and she makes me glad that i'm a man
oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
my baby makes me smile
lord don't she make me smile
she's never far away
or too tired to say i want you
she's always a lady
just like a lady should be
but when they turn out the lights
she's still a baby to me
'cause when we get behind closed doors
then she lets her hair hang down
and she makes me glad i'm a man
oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
behind closed doors 


i'm tired of havin' all these troubles think i've had enough
excuse me for sayin' but baby i'm callin' your bluff
there's been too many times too many reasons
too much cryin' out loud
too much bein' just another face in your crowd

oh and i've heard it before time and time again
you say it's the last time but it never ends
how much more can this poor heart take
you bend it until it breaks
there's been too many cards too many letters
strangers sending flowers
too much worry and stayin' up lately for hours
it's plain to see you don't care about me
you spread it all around
i'm tired of bein' the joke and the talk of the town


 
we loaded up my old station wagon
with a tent a coleman and sleeping bags
some fishing poles a cooler of cokes
three days before we had to be back
when you're seven you're in seventh heaven
when you're going camping in the wild outdoors
as we turned up on that old dirt road
he looked at me and swore
dad this could be the best day of my life
i've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
just me and you doing what i've always wanted to
i'm the luckiest boy alive
this is the best day of my life
his fifteenth birthday rolled around
classic cars were his thing
when i pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
i thought that boy would go in sane
when you're in your teens
your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
you worked nights on end
'till it was new again
and as he sat behind the wheel
he said dad
this could be the best day of my life
i've been dreaming day and night
about the fun we've had
just me and you
doing what i've always wanted to
i'm the luckiest boy alive
this is the best day of my life
standing in a little room
back of the church with our tuxes on
looking at him i say i can't believe son that you're grown
he said dad
this could be the best day of my life
i've been dreaming day and night
of being like you
now its me and her
watching you and mom i've learned
i'm the luckiest man alive
this is the best day of my life
i'm the luckiest man alive
this is the best day of my life 
finally got that promotion i worked hard to get
one that came with a company car
when they gave me the keys they said son you can bet
keep it up and you'll really go far

but what good is all that knowin'
the best thing that i had goin'
is gone
  
my good friends come around to hang out now and then
and they joke man you've sure got it hard
with this house on the hill and a white picket fence
and the grass sure is green in the yard

but what good is all that knowin'
the best thing that i had goin'
is gone
  
well i squandered my time trying to buy her everything
gave her all that i thought she deserved
now i know all the things that she wanted were free
and i should have been home holdin' her

but what good is all that knowin'
the best thing that i had goin'
is gone
is gone
  to fade  
i move on like a sinner's prayer 
lettin' go like a levee brakes 
walk away as if i don't care 
learn to shoulder my mistakes 
i'm built to fade like your favorite song 
get reckless when there's no need 
laugh as your stories ramble on 
break my heart but it won't bleed 
my only friends are pirates
it's just who i am
well i'm better as a memory
than as your man
i'm never sure when the truth won't do
i'm pretty good on a lonely night
i move on the way the storm blows through
i never stay but then again i might
i struggle sometimes to find the words
always sure until i doubt
walk a line until it blurs
build walls too high to climb out
but i'm honest to a fault
it's just who i am
i'm better as a memory
than as you man
i see you leaning
you're bound to fall
well i don't want to be that mistake
i'm just a dreamer nothing more
you should know it before it gets too late
'cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel 
you never know where they're gonna land 
first you're spinning then your standin' still 
left holdin' a losing hand 
but one day your gonna find someone 
and right away you'll know it's true 
that all of your seekin's done 
it's just a part of the passing through 
right there in that moment 
you'll finally understand 
that i was better as a memory than as your man 
better as a memory than as your man

written by tom shapiro terri clark  chris waters
don't tell me the reason that you're calling
is to see if i'm all right since you've been gone
'cause i know you and i know why we're talking
you're wanting me to say i'm barely hanging on
well maybe that was true for a night or two
but now i got better things to do
chrous
i could wash my car in the rain
change my new guitar strings
mow the yard just the same as i did yesterday
i don't need to waste my time crying over you
i got better things to do
maybe when i don't have so much going
or quite so many irons in the fire
i'll take the time to miss you like you're hoping
but now i can't put forth the effort it requires
well i'd love to talk to you but then i'd miss donahue
that's right i got better things to do
chrous
i could wash my car in the rain
change my new guitar strings
mow the yard just the same as i did yesterday
i don't need to waste my time crying over you
i got better things to do 


big john
big john
every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
he stood 6 foot 6 and weighed 245 
kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
and everybody knew you didn't give no lip
to big john
big john
big john
big bad john
big john
nobody seemed to know where john called home
he just drifted into town and stayed all alone
he didn't say much he's kinda quiet and shy
and if you spoke at all you just said hi to big john
somebody said he came from new orleans
where he got in a fight over a cajun queen
and a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
sent a louisiana fella to the promised land big john
big john
big john
big bad john
big john
then came the day at the bottom of the mine
when a timber cracked and men started cryin'
miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast 
and everybody thought that they'd breathed
their last 'cept john
through the dust and the smoke 
of this man made hell walked a giant of a man
that the miners knew well
grabbed a saggin' timber and gave out with a groan
and like a giant oak tree just stood there alone
big john
big john
big john
big bad john
big john
and with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
then a miner yelled out
there's a light up above
and 20 men scrambled from a would be grave
and now there's only one left down there to save
big john
with jacks and timbers they started back down
then came that rumble way down in the ground
and as smoke and gas belched out of that mine
everybody knew it was the end of the line
for big john
big john
big john
big bad john
big john
now they never reopened that worthless pit 
they just placed a marble stand in front of it
these few words are written on that stand
at the bottom of this mine lies one hell of a man
big john
big john
big john
big bad john
big john
big john 
big bad john 
toby keithscotty emerick

over there on the counter
you don't wanna read that thing man
it's a real getyoudowner
but don't you dare say nothin' else
bad about her she's gone

'cause tonight i might need it
it gets real lonely around here at night some times
an' i have to read read it
besides you can show it to the boys down town
they won't believe that she's gone
there used to be a time i was all she ever wanted
all the man that she'll ever need
i come home to find just like that she's up an' vanished
an' the only thing she left behind for me
is this big blue note
folded up in my pocket
yeah don't laugh it's been two months
i still got it
sometimes i have to read the sucker twice
just to make sure i ain't forgot that she's gone
you know my psychiatrist said
tell me what do you see
when you look at these inkspots
of er reds yellows an' greens
you know i looked at 'em all 
but they all looked to me like big blue notes
there used to be a time i was all she ever wanted
all the man that she'll ever need
i come home to find just like that she's up an' vanished
an' the only thing that's left to do for me
is stand high on this cliff
overlooking the sea
with my big blue notepaper aeroplane
that i just set free
an' i'm gonna wait here a few more minutes
an' if it don't come back to me
you guessed it she's gone
crash landing
bye bye baby 
i'd hook my wagon to my trike and i'd
head across the yard
to my big sandbox where i worked real hard
playing all day with my little toy trucks
backhoes bulldozers earthmoving stuff
that was my whole life when i was a kid
but when i grew up i guess i never really did
i like

big boy toys motors and lights
knobs and switches and a fourwheeldrive
running up the road or crawling across the
farm
and when they break down i jack them up in 
the yard
pull out my tools my pride and joy
man you gotta love them big boy toys
now sometimes baby just can't understand
the mud on my boots and the grease on my
hands
i try to explain how it makes me feel
the awesome power of my hands on the 
wheel
if i can't find the words to set things right
i just scoot over and i let my baby drive she
likes

bridge yeah it's boats and cars tractors and trucks
gasoline and diesel fuel a running through
my blood  i like them

man you gotta love them big boy toys

1st verse 
i'm a collector of masterpieces 
totally into original things 
and i've got priceless art hangin' on my walls 
and i love the noise that creative brings 
ain't got a vault or security 
it's not a velvet rope kind of gallery 
it's just 
 
sunshine smilin' on plain white paper 
cardboard cutouts with angel wings 
rainbow drawings by tiny fingers 
and a big ol' castle out of popsicle sticks 
but my favorite piece ain't got a frame 
it's on the 'fridgerator door with the misspelled name 
with a cat and the dog and janie and her sister 
there i am in the middle of the real big picture 
2nd verse 
used to be the paper now it's paper dolls 
i'm dodgin' crayolas on the kitchen floor 
and sometimes i rush to work for peace and quiet 
but i miss it all once i'm out the door 
and when the world gets crazy and cold 
lucky me i get to come home to that 
 
tag  
yeah you know my favorite piece ain't got a frame 
it's on the 'fridgerator door with the misspelled name 
with a cat and the dog and janie and her sister 
there i am in the middle of the real big picture 
the real big picture 
there i am in the middle of the real big picture yeah 
the sunshine is smilin' 
the real big picture

i set out on a narrow way many years ago
hoping i would find true love along the broken road
but i got lost a time or two
wiped my brow and kept pushing through
i couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
every long lost dream lead me to where you are
others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to you
i think about the years i spent just passing through
i'd like to have the time i lost and give it back to you
but you just smile and take my hand
you've been there you understand
it's all part of a grander plan that is coming true
every long lost dream lead me to where you are
others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to you 

she loves a violin i love a fiddle
we go separate ways but we meet in the middle
don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
a blue blooded woman and a redneck man
the lady i love loves silk and satin
she was raised uptown with a silver spoon
well i was born on a farm just south of jackson
we had an old ford tractor and a country moon
she loves a violin i love a fiddle
we go separate ways but we meet in the middle
don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
a blue blooded woman and a redneck man
she's saks fifth avenue perfection
caviar and dignified
well i live my life in wal mart fashion
and i like my sushi southern fried
she loves a violin i love a fiddle
we go separate ways but we meet in the middle
don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
a blue blooded woman and a redneck man
she loves a violin i love a fiddle
we go separate ways but we meet in the middle
don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
a blue blooded woman and a redneck man
she's a blue blooded woman i'm a redneck man 
in the twilight glow i see her
blue eyes crying in the rain
when we kissed goodbye and parted
i knew we'd never meet again
love is like a dying ember
and only memories remain
and through the ages i'll remember
blue eyes crying in the rain
someday when we meet up yonder
we'll stroll hand in hand again
in the land that knows no parting
for blue eyes crying in the rain 

i bless the day i found you
i want to stay around you
and so i beg you let it be me
don't take this heaven from one
if you must cling to someone
now and forever let it be me
each time we meet love
i find complete love
without your sweet love what would life be
so never leave me lonely
tell me you love me only
and that you'll always let it be me
each time we meet love
i find complete love
without your sweet love what would life be
so never leave me lonely
tell me you love me only
and that you'll alwaysletit'beme

he's just a singer
a natural born guitar ringer
kind of a clinger to sad old songs
he's not a walk behinder
he's a new note finder
his name's a reminder of a blues man 
that's already gone
so he started drinking and took some things
that messed up his thinking
he was sure sinking when she came along
he was alone in the spot light not to much left inside
she changed all that one night
when she sang him this song 
hey baby i love you
hey baby i need you
hey baby you ain't got to prove to me
you're some kind of macho man
you wasted so much of your life running through the dark nights
let me shine a little love light down on that blues man
he got so sick from speeding all the things
they said he was needing if he was to keep on pleasing all of his fans
he got cuffed on dirt roads
he got sued over no shows
she came and took all that old down off of that blues man
and he sang
hey baby i love you too
hey baby i need you
hey baby i do get tired of this traveling band
i'm over 40 years old now
nights would be cold now 
if you hadn't stuck it out with this blues man
he's over 40 years old now
nights would be so cold now
if she hadn't hung around with that blues man 
blue
oh so lonesome for you
why can't you be blue over me
blue
oh so lonesome for you
tears fill my eyes 'till i can't see
3 o'clock in the mornin here am i
sitting here so lonely so lonesome i could cry
blue
oh so lonesome for you
why can't you be blue over me
now that it's over i realize 
those weak words you wispered were nothing but lies 
blue 
oh so lonesome for you 
why can't you be blue over me 
why can't you be blue over me

well my momma met my daddy down in alabama they tied the knot so here i am
born on the bayou on the texas line loved louisanana and raised on jabalaya

went on the road when i was eight years old when i turned fifteen i was stealing the show
money to burn and the girls were pretty it didn't take me long to learn that i was born to boogie
when i was eighteen i went to hollywood i met elvis marilyn and johnny b goode
got my guitar painted in the california sun a red caddilac having to much fun
now we were playing them halls and jammin' then until they moved me on over to mgm
they said this is the boy we've been telling you about he lit a cigar and stuck his hand out
he said son have we got a deal for you gonna make you a star give you fifty thousand too

i'll take your money i'll make you a movie but i can tell ya' right now i am born to boogie
well my name is bocephus i drink whiskey by the gallon and i never back down and i love a good challenge 
what i do now is what i did then i like to get down with all my rowdy friends

my shades are chromo my guitar is steal if you think i won't then believe me i will
get down on you baby because i ain't no rookie i was put here to party and i was born to boogie 



verse 1
she said i need sometime to find myself
i need a little space to think
maybe we should start seeing other people
baby things are moving way to fast for me
so i i picked up what was left of my pride
and i put on my walking shoes
and i got up on that high road
and i did what any gentleman would do
i um

i got a brand new girlfriend
we went and jumped off the deep end
flew out to la for the weekend
spent the whole day lyin' on the beach
wearin' nothin' but a smile
playin' kissykissy smoochysmoochy
talkin' mooshymooshy bout nothin'
man i think im on to somethin'
yano i feel just like a kid again
i got a brand new girlfriend
verse 2
i love it when she calls me butter cup
laughs and says i left the toilet seat up
she pops and tosses me a cold beer
and says my buddies always welcome here
when i get hungry she takes me out
i ride the shotgun like a shitzu hound
my tails a waggin' my tounges hangin' out
it makes me wanna shout

wooo
cute cute cute
she likes to write our names in the sand
shes hearing wedding bells and making plans
shes gonna hang around a while i guess
she hasnt even told me she loves me yet

she makes me feel just like a kid again
i gotta brand new girlfriend 
i can feel the magic floating in the air
being with you gets me that way
i watch the sunlight dance across your face
and i've never been this swept away
all my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
when i'm lying wrapped up in your arms
the whole world just fades away
the only thing i hear is the beating of your heart

cause i can feel you breathe
it's washing over me
and suddenly i'm melting into you
there's nothing left to prove
baby all we need is just to be
caught up in the touch
slow and steady rush
baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be
i can feel you breathe
just breathe
in a way i know my heart is waking up
as all the walls come tumbling down
closer than i've ever felt before
and i know and you know
there's no need for words right now

caught up in the touch
slow and steady rush
baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be
i can feel you breathe just breathe
i can feel the magic floating in the air
being with you gets me that way 

you got someone here wants to make alright
someone who loves you more than life right here 
you got willing arms that'll hold you tight
a hand to lead you on through the night right here
i know your heart can get all tangled up inside
but don't you keep it to yourself

when your long day is over
and you can bearly drag your feet
the weight of the world is on your shoulders
i know what you need
bring it on home to me
you know i know you like the back of my hand
but did you know i'm gonna do all that i can right here
i'm gonna lie with you till you fall asleep
when the morning comes i'm still gonna be right here yes i am
so take your worries and just drop them at the door
baby leave it all behind

baby let me be you safe harbor
don't let the water come and carry you away

you got someone here wants to make it alright
someone who loves you more than life right here

another day has almost come and gone
can't imagine what else could go wrong
sometimes i'd like to hide away somewhere and lock the door
a single battle lost but not the war 
cause tomorrow's another day
and i'm thirsty anyway
so bring on the rain
it's almost like the hard times circle 'round
a couple drops and they all start coming down
yeah i might feel defeated
i might hang my head
i might be barely breathing  but i'm not dead no
cause tomorrow's another day
and i'm thirsty anyway
so bring on the rain
i'm not gonna let it get me down
i'm not gonna cry
and i'm not gonna lose any sleep tonight
cause tomorrow's another day
and i am not afraid
so bring on the rain
cause tomorrow's another day
and i'm thirsty anyway
so bring on the rain
ooh
bring on bring on the rain
no i'm not gonna get me down
i'm not gonna cry
so bring on the rain
ooh
bring on bring on the rain
bring on the rain
bring on the rain
ooh

we were all down at margie's bar 
telling stories if we had one
someone fired the old jukebox up
the song sure was a sad one
a teardrop rolled down bubba's nose 
from the pain the song was inflicting
and all at once he jumped to his feet 
just like somebody kicked him
bubba shot the juke box last night
said it played a sad song it made him cry
went to his truck and got a forty five
bubba shot the juke box last night
bubba ain't never been accused of being mentality stable
so we did not draw an easy breathe 
until he laid that colt on the table
he hung his head till the cops showed up
they dragged him right out of margie's
told him don't play dumb with us son
know damn well what the charge is
bubba shot the juke box last night
said it played a sad song it made him cry
went to his truck and got a forty five
bubba shot the juke box last night
well the sheriff arrived with his bathrobe on
the confrontation was a tense one
shook his head said bubba boy
you was always a dense one
reckless discharge of a gun
that's what the officers are claiming
bubba hollered reckless hell 
i shot just where i was aiming
bubba shot the juke box last night
said it played a sad song it made him cry
went to his truck and got a forty five
bubba shot the juke box stopped it with one shot
bubba shot the jukebox last night
well he could not tell right from wrong
through the teardrops in his eyes
beyond a shadow of a doubt
it was justifiable homicide
bubba shot the juke box stopped it with one shot
bubba shot the jukebox last night 
since you've gone my heart said something's wrong
how long can this keep goin' on
i'm still blue over losin' you
what else am i gonna do
i'm buildin' bridges straight to your heart
an' all of this distance won't keep us apart
won't keep us apart 
talk to me talk to me about sympathy
don't leave me beggin' on my knees
since you've gone my heart says something's wrong
how long can this keep goin' on
i'm buildin' bridges straight to your heart
and all of this distance won't keep us apart
won't keep us apart 

i'm buildin' bridges straight to your heart
and all of this distance won't keep us apart
won't keep us apart 
i'm buildin' bridges i'm buildin' bridges

and all of this distance won't keep us apart

i guess you're off to have your fun 
another ending just begun 
and i know what i don't see really shouldn't bother me 
so go and have yourself a ball 
you'll be at no one's beck and call 
and with that fire in your eyes 
another lover's moon will rise 
and someone else will take the fall 
and that's just the way you are 
i've known all along 
some candles always burn even when the night is gone 
but the strongest of flames won't burn eternally 
when you find another friend who'll light your candle up again 
you can burn one down for me 
so you don't matter anymore 
i'll convince myself i'm sure as if i give a damn 
that's just the way i am 
so go on and pour yourself some wine 
with who'll ever spend your time 
'cause anyone can see you won't be crying over me 
and you never were that kind 
 
i don't like to be alone in the night
and i don't like to hear i'm wrong when i'm right
and i don't like to have the rain on my shoe
but i do love you
but i do love you
i don't like to see the sky painted gray
and i don't like when nothing's going my way
and i don't like to be the one with the blues
but i do love you
but i do love you

love everything about the way you're loving me
the way you lay your head
upon my shoulder when you sleep
and i love to kiss you in the rain
i love everything you do oh i do
i don't like to turn the radio on
just to find i missed my favorite song
and i don't like to be the last with the news
but i do love you
but i do love you

and i don't like to be alone in the night
and i don't like to hear i'm wrong when i'm right
and i don't like to have the rain on my shoes
but i do love you 
but i do love you
but i do love you
but i do love you 
button off my shirt
i've heard the word going 'round town
they say that you're making a fool out of me
baby it took me some time to come 'round
to realize you were not what you seem
each day's passing the clock's been my friend
helped me get back on my feet again
like a button off my shirt
just an everyday distraction
you'd be over reacting if you think that i still hurt
you're just a button off my shirt and someday i will replace you 
i don't care what i have lost
you got what you deserve
i was down down downi was down
i'm not the first and i won't be the last
to make the mistake of believing in you
i don't intend to live in the past
just like they saysome you win some you lose
you never loved me and you made it plain
now it's my turn and i'm playing your game
like a button off my shirt
just an everyday distraction
you'd be over reacting if you think that i still hurt
you're just a button off my shirt and some day i will replace you 
i don't care what i have lost
you got what you deserve
love and affection
you started changing directions
you threw it away
girl you threw it away
you never loved me and you made it plain
now it's my turn to make you understand
like a button off my shirt
just an everyday distraction
you'd be over reacting if you think that i still hurt
you're just a button off my shirt and someday i will replace you
i don't care what i have lost
you got what you deserved
like the button off my shirt 
just an everyday distraction
you'd be over reacting if you think that i still hurt
you're just a button off my shirt and someday i will replace you
i don't care what i have lost you got what you deserved
like a button off my shirt

you're just a button off my shirt and someday i will replace you

by the time i get to phoenix
she'll be rising
she'll find the note i left hanging on her door
she'll laugh when she reads the part that says i'm leaving
cause i've left that girl so many times before
by the time i make albuquerque
she'll be working
she'll probably stop at lunch 
and give me a call
but she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
off the wall that's all
by the time i make oklahoma
she'll be sleeping
she'll turn softly and call my name out low
and she'll cry just to think i'd really leave her
though time and time i've tried to tell her so
she just didn't know
i would really go 
he's cadillac jack favor and the name rings true 
if he's got a ride any stranger would too 
the one bad habit that his ponder would say 
is sure gonna put him through the trials one day 
and that's just what happened he took pity on two men 
headin' down to louisiana he stopped and let 'em in 
and the thanks he'd get for helpin' them 
would make him wish he was bustin' broncs again 
bridge 
he dropped 'em off in bossier city where they met up with a man 
now that vagabond committee barely even had a plan 
it was just a simple robbery turned double homicide 
and they got away with murder it'd be someone else's hide 
almost two years come and gone they never solved that crime 
'til they found one of our vagabonds already doing time 
and when that jailbird started singing 
they know all the words were wrong 
but the sheriff and the da and the judge all sang along 
they pinned it on jack favor gave him life without parole 
gave jack's freedom to the jailbird payment on the lies he told 
and it just so happens that election year 
everybody made out at the polls 
 
cadillac's no fallen hero and he's never gonna break 
when it comes to prison rodeo there'll be no easy eight 
and if you want the definition of a picture perfect frame 
it be in the dictionary underneath jack favor's name 
 
yeah it's the wold's most crooked picture 
and when it comes to being framed 
cadillac jack favor should be in the hall of fame 
there she sits buddy just a gleamin' in the sun
there to greet a workin' man when his day is done
i'm gonna pack my pa and i'm gonna pack my aunt
i'm gonna take 'em down to the cadillac ranch
eldorado fins white walls and skirts
drives just like a little bit of heaven here on earth
so when i die buddy throw my body in the back
take me to the junkyard in my cadillac

cadillac cadillac
long and dark
shiny and black
open up your engines let 'em roar
tearin' up the highway like a big ol' dinosaur
james dean in a mercury '49
junior johnson's runnin' in the woods of caroline
even burt reynolds in a black trans am
all gonna meet down at the cadillac ranch

hey little girlie in the blue jeans so tight
driving all alone in a colorado night
you're my last love baby you're my last chance
don't let 'em take me down to the cadillac ranch
 2x 
i spent last night in the arms
of a girl in louisiana
and though i'm out on the highway
my thoughts are still with her
such a strange combination of a woman and a child
such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles
callin' baton rouge
a replay of last night's events
roll through my mind
except a scene or two
erased by sweet red wine
and i see a truck stop sign ahead
so i change lanes
i need a cup of coffee
and a couple dollars change
callin' baton rouge
operator won't you put me on through
i gotta' send my love down to baton rouge
hurry up won't you put her on the line
i gotta' talk to the girl just one more time
hello samantha dear i hope you're feelin' fine
and it won't be long until i'm with you all the time
but until then i'll spend my money up right down to my last dime
callin' baton rouge
operator won't you put me on through
i gotta' send my love down to baton rouge
hurry up won't you put her on the line
i gotta' talk to the girl just one more time
oh in baton rouge
sweet baton rouge my baton rouge 

i never felt as helpless as i do today
my world just fell around me as i watched you drive away
theres nothing left between us somehow we've grown apart
cause i've got through my head i just can't break it to my heart

i can't believe this is me on the hurtin side of pain
siftin through the ashes still tryin to find a flame
but the flame has turned to embers left glowing in the dark
i've got it through my head i just can't break it to my heart
if i could lord knows i would spin back the hands of time
and piece these scattered memories that are cluttered in my head
pick up where we left off and make a brand new start
i've got it through my head i just can't break it to my heart

i can't believe this is me on the hurtin side of pain
siftin through the ashes still tryin to find a flame
but the flame has turned to embers left glowing in the dark
i've got it through my head i just can't break it to my heart 
under the lovers sky
gonna be with you
and no one's gonna be around
if you think that you won't fall
well just wait until
'til the sun goes down
underneath the starlight starlight
there's a magical feeling so right
it will steal your heart tonight
you can try to resist
try to hide from my kiss
don't you know don't you know
that you can't fight the moonlight
deep in the dark you'll surrender your heart
but you know but you know that you
can't fight the moonlightno
you can't fight it
it's gonna get to your heart
there's no escaping love
once the gentle breeze
weaves a spell upon your heart
no matter what you think
it won't be too long
'til you're in my arms
underneath the starlight starlight
we'll be lost in the rhythm so right
feel it steal your heart tonight
you can try to resist
try to hide from my kiss
but you know but you know
that you can't fight the moonlight
deep in the dark you'll surrender your heart
but you know but you know that you

there's a magical feeling so right
it'll steal your heart tonight
you can try to resist try to hide from my kiss
but you know but you know that you
can't fight the moonlight
deep in the dark you'll surrender your heart
but you know but you know that you
can't fight the moonlight
no you can't fight it
you can try to resist try to hide from my kiss
but you know but you know that you
can't fight the moonlight
deep in the dark you'll surrender your heart

but the more they run my name down
the more my price goes up

'cause when you're a celebrity
it's adios reality
no matter what you do
people think you're cool
just cause you're on tv
i can fall in and out of love
have marriages that barely last a month
when they go down the drain
i'll blame it on the fame
and say it's just so tough
being a celebrity
so let's hitch up the wagons and head out west
to the land of fun in the sun
we'll be real world bachelors
jackass millionaires
hey hey hollywood

yeah when you're a celebrity
it's adios reality
no matter what you do
people think you're cool
just cause you're on tv
being a celebrity

well way down yonder on the chattahoochee
it gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
we laid rubber on the georgia asphalt
we got a little crazy but we never got caught
down by the river on a friday night
pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
yeah way down yonder on the chattahoochee
never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
but i learned how to swim and i learned who i was
a lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
ya ha
well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
i was willin' but she wasn't ready
so i settled for a burger and a grape snocone
i dropped her off early but i didn't go home
down by the river on a friday night
pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
yeah way down yonder on the chattahochee
never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
but i learned how to swim and i learned who i was
a lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

this town ain't big this town ain't small
it's a little of both they say
our ball club may be minor league but at least it's triple a
we sit below the marlboro man above the right field wall
we do the wave all by ourself
hey ump a blind man could've made that call

we like our beer flat as can be
we like our dogs with mustard and relish
we got a great pitcher what's his name
well we can't even spell it
we don't worry about the pennant much
we just like to see the boys hit it deep
there's nothing like the view from the cheap seats
the game was close we'll call it a win
go off to toast the boys again
that local band is back in town
they got a kinda minor league sound
they're not that bad they're not that good
but all in all it's understood
we wanna dance they wanna play
we wouldn't have it any other way

we like our beer flat as can be
we like our dogs with mustard and relish
we got a great pitcher what's his name
well we can't even spell it
we don't worry about the pennant much
we just like to see the boys hit it deep
there's nothing like the view from the cheap seats
cheap seats
now the majors called up ol' what's his name
and one more buildin' rises tall
and suddenly we're all grown up
and this old town not quite so small
but i'll always miss the middle size town
in the middle of the middlewest
with no name pitchers and local bands
and mustard and relish and all the rest

we like our beer flat as can be
we like our dogs with mustard and relish
we got a great pitcher what's his name
well we can't even spell it
we don't worry about the pennant much
we just like to see the boys hit it deep
there's nothing like the view from the cheap seats
cheap seats 
you say your every day is a bad dream that keeps repeatin'
maybe you should have thought about that when you were cheatin'
how do you like that furnished room the bed the chair the table
the tv picture comes and goes too bad you don't have cable
how do you like that paper plate and those porknbeans you're eatin'
maybe you should have thought about that when you were cheatin'
how do you like that beatup car i think it's fair we traded
your pickup truck is running fine it's a cozy ride for datin'
yes i've been out a time or two and found the comfort i've been needin'
maybe you should have thought about that when you were cheatin'
you made your bed and you're out of mine
you lie awake and i sleep just fine
you've done your sowin' now you can do the reapin'
maybe you should have thought about that when you were cheatin'
now what became of what'shername after she spent all your money
did she leave you just like you left me well sometimes life is funny
yes i'll be glad to take you back just as soon as i stop breathin'
maybe you should have thought about that
oh maybe you should have thought about that 
maybe you should have thought about that when you were cheatin'
when you were cheatin' 
you know i like my chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i was raised up beneath the shade of a georgia pine
and that's home you know
sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
where the peaches grow
and my house it's not much to talk about
but it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
and a little bit of chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i've seen the sunrise
see the love in my woman's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother's love
well its funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
not where you live or what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
there's no dollar sign on a piece of mind this i've come to know
so if you agree have a drink with me
raise you glasses for a toast
to a little bit of chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i've seen the sunrise
see the love in my woman's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother's love
i thank god for my life
and for the stars and stripes
may freedom forever fly let it ring
salute the ones who died
the ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
all the things we love
like our chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well i've seen the sunrise
see the love in my woman's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother's love 

welll i'm a sucker for fine cuban cigars
the problem is i can't afford 'em
but last year i went and got myself a whole box
and just to be safe i insured 'em

i took out a policy against fire and theft
and then i hurried home
with a fiftycent lighter i sat on my back steps
and i smoked 'em one by one
two weeks later i went to see that insurance man
and i handed in my claim
with a straight face i told him that through a series of small fires 
they'd all gone up in flames

they reviewed my case and they had no choice
but to pay me for what i'd done
and i took that check and bought a whole new box
and i smoked 'em one by one
  
two weeks later this detective shows up
tells me that company's pressin' charges
one speedy trial later they locked me up
on twentyfour separate counts of arson

and now i sit and i stare at a blank brick wall
lookin' back on what i've done
to pass the time i've got some tencent cigars
and i smoke 'em one by one
yeah i smoke 'em one by one 
ridin' on the city of new orleans illinois central monday morning rail
fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
three conductors and twentyfive sacks of mail
all along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of kankakee
and rolls along past houses farms and fields
passing trains that have no name and graveyards full of old black men
and graveyards full of rusted automobiles
good morning america how are you say don't you know me i'm your native son
i'm the train they call the city of new orleans
and i'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
dealin' cards with an old man in the club car
penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
and feel the wheels a rumbling neath the floor
and the sons of poor men porters and the sons of engineers
ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
mothers with their babes asleep rockin' to that gentle beat
and the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
good morning america
 guitar 
night time on the city of new orleans changing cars in memphis tennessee
half way home we'll be there by morning
through the mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
and all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
and the steel rails still ain't heard the news
the conductor sings his songs again the passengers will please refrain
this train has got the disappearing railroad blues
good morning america 
the declaration of independence 
think i can tell you that first sentence 
but then i'm lost 
i can't begin to count the theories 
i had pounded in my head that i forgot 
i don't remember all that spanish 
or the gettysburg address 
but there is one speech from high school 
i'll never forgot 
 
come on in boy sit on down 
and tell me ëbout yourself 
so you like my daughter do you now 
yeah we think she's something else 
she's her daddy's girl and her mama's world 
she deserves respect that's what she'll get ain't it son 
now y'all run along and have some fun 
i'll see you when you get back 
bet i'll be up all night 
still cleaning this gun 
well now that i'm a father 
i'm scared to death one day my daughter's gonna find 
that teenage boy i used to be 
who seems to have just one thing on his mind 
she's growing up so fast it won't be long 
ëfore i'll have to put the fear of god 
into some kid at the door 
 
it's all for show ain't nobody gonna get hurt 
it's just a daddy thing hey believe me man it works 
 
well i said he had a lot of potential
he was only misunderstood
you know he really didn't mean to treat me so bad
he wanted to be good
and i swore one day i would tame him
even though he loves to run hog wild
just call me cleopatra everybody
cause i'm the queen of denial
well i knew he didn't have any money
that's why he couldn't buy me a ring
oh and just because he bought himself a brand new pickup truck
really didn't prove anything
and he never had to say he loved me
i could see it everytime he smiled
just call me cleopatra everybody
cause i'm the queen of denial
oh queen of denial
buyin' all his alibis
queen of denial
just floating down a river of lies
now i'm not gonna jump to conclusions
or throw away this perfect romance
even though i saw him dancing last night
with a girl in leopard skin pants
oh he's probably stuck in traffic
and he'll be here in a little while
just call me cleopatra everybody
cause i'm the queen of denial
queen of denial
buying all his alibis
queen of denial
just floating down a river of lies

women are fools when it comes to you
they gotcha doin'things you can't undo
like a chain of heartaches around your neck
give'em enough rope and they'll hang you yet

why does love have to hurt so bad
to drive a man downtown every night
i tell ya something ain't right
something's real wrong
in the morning when i wake up
you'll still be gone

living in the city
ain't never been my idea
of getting it on
but the job demands
that you make new plans
before your big chance is gone
you get a house in the hills
you're paying everyones bills
and they tell you that
you're gonna go far
but in the back of my mind
i hear it time after time
is that who you really are
country boy
you got your feet in la
but your mind's on tennessee
looking back i can
remember the time
when i sang my songs for free
country boy
you got your feet in la
take a look at everything you own
but now and then
my heart keeps going home
talking on the telephone
setting up another day
of people to meet
you've gotta do what's right
you've gotta spend the night
staying in touch with the street
when you're surrounded by friends
they say the fun never ends
but i guess i'll never figure it out
cause in the back of my mind
i hear it time after time
is this what its all about
country boy
you got your feet in la
but your mind's on tennessee
looking back i can
remember the time
when i sang my songs for free
country boy

take a look at everything you own

my heart keeps going home
country boy
you got your feet in la
but your mind's on tennessee

evryone considered him the coward of the county
hed never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
his mama named him tommy the folks just called him yellow
but something always told me they were reading tommy wrong
he was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
i looked after tommy cause he was my brothers son

in her arms he didnt have to prove he was a man
one day while he was workin the gatlin boys came callin
they took turns at becky there was three of them
tommy opened up the door and saw his becky cryin
the torn dress the shattered look was more than he could stand
he reached above the fireplace and took down his daddys picture
as his tears fell on his daddys face he heard these words again
promise me son not to do the things ive done
walk away from trouble if you can
it wont mean youre weak if you turn the other cheek
i hope youre old enough to understand
son you dont have to fight to be a man
the gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
one of them got up and met him halfway cross the floor
when tommy turned around they said hey look ol yellows leavin
but you coulda heard a pin drop when tommy stopped and blocked the door
twenty years of crawlin was bottled up inside him
he wasnt holdin nothin back he let em have it all
when tommy left the barroom not a gatlin boy was standin
he said this ones for becky as he watched the last one fall
and i heard him say
i promised you dad not to do the things you done
i walk away from trouble when i can
now please dont think im weak i didnt turn the other cheek
and papa i sure hope you understand
sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man

i said i want to touch the earth
i want to break it in my hands
i want to grow something wild and unruly
i want to sleep on the hard ground
in the comfort of your arms
on a pillow of bluebonnets
in a blanket made of stars
oh it sounds good to me
i said cowboy take me away
fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
set me free oh i pray
closer to heaven above and closer to you 
closer to you
i want to walk and not run
i want to skip and not fall
i want to look at the horizon
and not see a building standing tall
i want to be the only one
for miles and miles
except for maybe you
and your simple smile
oh it sounds good to me
yes it sounds so good to me
cowboy take me away
fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
set me free oh i pray
closer to heaven above and closer to you
closer to you

i want to break it in my hands
i want to grow something wild and unruly
oh it sounds so good to me
cowboy take me away
fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
set me free oh i pray
closer to heaven above and closer to you
closer to you
closer to you

i wanna lay a blanket down

about getting back
back to our hearts beating wild
in the back of my beat up truck
back to those butterflies
first time we felt in love
back to your smiling eyes

crazy
i'm crazy for feeling so lonely
i'm crazy
crazy for feeling so blue
i knew
you'd love me as long as you wanted
and then some day
you'd leave me for somebody new
worry
why do i let myself worry
wondering
what in the world did i do
oh crazy
for thinking that my love could hold you
i'm crazy for trying
and crazy for crying
and i'm crazy for loving you
crazy
for thinking that my love could hold you
i'm crazy for trying
and crazy for crying
and i'm crazy for loving 
you 





i was all right for awhile
i could smile for awhile
but i saw you last night
you held my hand so tight
as you stopped to say hello
oh you wished me well
you you couldn't tell
that i'd been crying over you
crying over you
when you said so long
left me standing all alone
alone and crying crying
crying crying
it's hard to understand
but the touch of your hand
can start me crying
i thought that i was over you
but it's true so true
i love you even more
than i did before
but darling what can i do
for you don't love me
and i'll always be crying over you
crying over you
yes now you're gone
and from this moment on
i'll be crying crying
crying crying
yeah crying crying
over you 

if i had just one tear running down your cheek 
maybe i could cope
maybe i'd get some sleep
if i had just one moment at your expense
maybe all my misery would be well spent 
could you cry a little
lie just a little
pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
i gave now i'm wanting something in return
so cry just a little for me 
if your love could be caged 
honey i would hold the key
and conceal it underneath
the pile of lies you handed me
and you'd hunt those lies
they'd be all you'd ever find
that'd be all you'd have to know 
for me to be fine
and you'd cry a little
and die just a little
and baby i would feel just a little less pain 
i gave now i'm wanting something in return 
so cry just a little for me
give it up baby 
i hear you're doin' fine
nothing's gonna save me 
till i see it in your eyes 
some kind of heartache honey
give it a try
i don't want pity 
i just want what is mine
yeah 
could you cry a little 
lie just a little
pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
i gave now i'm wanting something in return
so cry just a little for me 
yeah 
cry just a little for me
whoa whoa
could you cry a little for me 
hmmm yeah yeah 
our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
so we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
like toy or maybe sur prise
but the words we're hiding from him now
tear the heart right out of me
our divorce becomes final today
me and little joe will be goin' away
i love you both and this will be pure he double l for me
oh i wish that we could stop this divorce
watch him smile he thinks it christmas
or his 5th birthday
and he thinks custody spells fun or play
i spell out all the hurtin' words
and turn my head when i speak
'cause i can't spell away this hurt
that's drippin' down my cheek
our divorce becomes final today
me and little joe will be goin' away
i love you both and this will be pure he double l for me
oh i wish that we could stop this divorce 
i remember daddy's hands folded silently in prayer
and reaching out to hold me when i had a nightmare
you could read quite a story in the caluses and lines
years of work and worry had left their mark behind
i remember daddy's hands how they held my momma tight
and patted my back for something done right
there are things that i've forgotten that i loved about the man
but i'll always remember the love in daddy's hands

daddy's hands were soft and kind when i was cryin
daddy's hands were hard as steel when i'd done wrong
daddy's hands weren't always gentle but i've come to understand
there was always love in daddy's hands
i remember daddy's hands working til they bled
sacrificed unselfishly just to keep us all fed
if i could do things over i'd live my life again
and never take for granted the love in daddy's hands

daddy's hands were soft and kind when i was cryin
daddy's hands were hard as steel when i'd done wrong
daddy's hands weren't always gentle but i've come to understand
there was always love in daddy's hands
repeat 

raul malo
here comes my happiness again
right back to where it should have been
'cause now she's gone and i am free
and she can't do a thing to me
i just wanna dance the night away
with senoritas who can sway
right now tomorrow's lookin' bright
just like the sunny mornin' light
and if you should see her
please let her know that i'm well
as you can tell
and if she should tell you
that she wants me back
tell her no
i gotta go
i just wanna dance the night away
with senoritas who can sway
right now tomorrow's lookin' bright
just like the sunny mornin' light
and if you should see her
please let her know that i'm well
as you can tell
and if she should tell you
that she wants me back
tell her no
i gotta go
i just wanna dance the night away
with senoritas who can sway
right now tomorrow's lookin' bright
just like the sunny mornin' light
i just wanna dance the night away
with senoritas who can sway
right now tomorrow's lookin' bright
just like the sunny mornin' light 


lookin' back
on the memory of
the dance we shared
beneath the stars above
and for a moment
all the world was right
but how could i have known
that you'd ever say goodbye
and now
i'm glad i didn't know
the way it all would end
the way it all would go
our lives
are better left to chance
i could have missed the pain
but i'da had to miss the dance
holding you
i held everything
and for a moment
wasn't i a king
but if i'd only known
how the king would fall
hey who's to say
you know i might have changed it all
and now
i'm glad i didn't know
the way it all would end
the way it all would go
our lives
are better left to chance
i could have missed the pain
but i'da had to miss the dance
yes my life
it's better left to chance
i could've missed the pain
but i'da had to miss
the dance 

people smile and tell me i'm the lucky one
and we've just begun
i think i'm gonna have a son
he will be like him and me as free as a dove
conceived in love
the sun is gonna shine above
and even though we ain't got money
i'm so in love with you honey
everything will bring a chain of love
and in the morning when i rise
bring a tear of joy to my eyes
and tell me everything's gonna be all right
love a guy who holds the world in a paper cup
drink it up
love him and he'll bring you luck
and if you find he helps your mind better take him home
yeah and don't you live alone
try to earn what lovers own
and even though we ain't got money
i'm so in love with you honey
everything will bring a chain of love
and in the morning when i rise
bring a tear of joy to my eyes
and tell me everything's gonna be all right
and even though we ain't got money
i'm so in love with you honey
everything will bring a chain of love
and in the morning when i rise
bring a tear of joy to my eyes
and tell me everything's gonna be all right

daughter of mine
these are the thoughts of a father
on the wedding day of his daughter
as his mind wanders back to the first time he held her
he looks at her now the same pride in his eyes
as onto the dance floor they glide
this is the dance of the bride and her father
dance with me daughter of mine
on this your wedding day
dance with me daughter of mine
you'll soon be going away
i loved you since you first began
now you've found a new man
but i love you so and this you must know
that my love won't falter
so dance with me daughter
beautiful daughter of mine
we walk down the aisle
on my face there's a smile
but deep in my heart there's a tear
our friends and relations are here in the church
with smiles on their faces they stare
as we walk t'ward the man who has stolen your heart
and to whom i must give you away
but i wish you love and happiness too
on this your wedding day
 
the dance has begun
we twirl around the floor
but i know you're not my little girl anymore
a lovely young woman has taken her place
and there's happiness written all over her face
but always remember although we must part
you may leave my arms but never my heart
 




and he'll tell her he's working late again
but she knows too well there's something going on
she's been neglected and she needs a friend
so her trembling fingers dial the telephone
lord it hurts her doing this again
he's the best friend that her husband ever knew
when she's lonely he's more than just a friend
he's the one she longs to give her body to
daytime friends and nighttime lovers
hoping no one else discovers
where they go what they do in their secret hideaway
daytime friends and nighttime lovers
they don't want to hurt the others
so they love in the nighttime
and shake hands in the light of day
when it's over there's no peace of mind
just a longing for the way things should have been
and she wonders why some men never find
that a woman needs a lover and a friend
daytime friends and nighttime lovers
hoping no one else discovers
where they go what they do in their secret hideaway
daytime friends and nighttime lovers
they don't want to hurt the others
so they love in the nighttime
and shake hands in the light of day
daytime friends and nighttime lovers
hoping no one else discovers
where they go what they do in their secret hideaway
daytime friends and nighttime lovers
they don't want to hurt the others
so they love in the nighttime
and shake hands in the light of day
daytime friends and nighttime lovers
hoping no one else discovers
where they go what they do in their secret hideaway
daytime friends and nighttime lovers
they don't want to hurt the others
so they love in the nighttime
and shake hands in the light of day 
well i've heard those city singers singin 'bout how they can love
deeper than the oceans higher than the stars above
well i come from the country and i know i ain't seen it all
but i heard that oceans salty and the stars they sometimes fall
but that would not do justice to the way i feel for you
so i have to sing this song about all the things i knew
my love is deeper than the holler stronger than the rivers
higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
my love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late december
and honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
and longer than the song of the whippoorwill
from the backroads to the broadway shows with a million miles between
there's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
and everyone is different and everyone's the same
so this is just another way of sayin' the same thing
my love is deeper than the holler stronger than the rivers
higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
my love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late december
and honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
and longer than the song of the whippoorwill
my love is deeper than the holler stronger than the rivers
higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
my love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late december
and honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
and longer than the song of the whippoorwill 
delta dawn what's that flower you have on
could it be a faded rose from days gone by
and did i hear you say he was ameeting you here today
to take you to his mansion in the sky 
she's fortyone and her daddy still calls her baby
all the folks around brownsville say she's crazy
'cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand
looking for a mysterious darkhaired man
in her younger days they called her delta dawn
prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
then a man of low degree stood by her side
promised her he'd take her for his bride
delta dawn what's that flower you have on
could it be a faded rose from days gone by
and did i hear you say he was ameeting you here today
to take you to his mansion in the sky

the devil went down to georgia he was lookin' for a soul to steal
he was in a bind 'cause he was way behind he was willing to make a deal
when he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
and the devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said boy let me tell you what

and if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
but if you lose the devil gets your soul
the devil opened up his case and he said i'll start this show
and fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow 
and he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss 
and a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this 
when the devil finished johnny said well you're pretty good ol' son
but sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done
fire on the mountain run boys run 
the devil's in the house of the rising sun 
chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
granny does your dog bite no child no
the devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
and he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at johnny's feet
johnny said devil just come on back if you ever wanna try again 
'cause i've told you onceyou son of a bitchi'm the best there's ever been
and he played 
fire on the mountain run boys run 
the devil's in the house of the rising sun 
chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough

i told mary about us
i told her about our great sin
mary cried and forgave me
then mary took me back again
said if i wanted my freedom
i could be free ever more
but i don't want to be
and i don't want to see
mary cry anymore
oh devil woman
devil woman let go of me
devil woman let me be
and leave me alone
i want to go home
mary is waitin' and weepin'
down in our shack by the sea
even after i've hurt her
mary's still in love with me
devil woman it's over
trapped no more by your charms
cause i don't want to stay
i want to get away
woman let go of my arm
oh devil woman
devil woman let go of me
devil woman let me be
and leave me alone
i want to go home
devil woman you're evil
like the dark coral reef
like the winds that bring high tides
you bring sorrow and grief
you made me ashamed to face mary
barely had the strength to tell
skies are not so black
mary took me back
mary has broken your spell
oh devil woman
devil woman let go of me
devil woman let me be
and leave me alone
i want to go home
runnin' along by the seashore
runnin' as fast as i can
even the seagulls are happy
glad i'm comin' home again
never again will i ever
cause another tear to fall
down the beach i see
what belongs to me
the one i want most of all
oh devil woman
devil woman don't follow me
devil woman let me be
and leave me alone
i'm goin' back home

it's a mighty wild ride that you've been takin' me on
sometimes i feel like a dog standin' on a toolbox
in the back of a pickup truck doin' 90 'round a corner
just tryin' to hang on for dear life
when you had to have a little pink house i said ok
when you pulled your harley up to a church i just prayed
my life is like a mobile home in a hurricane
sometimes i feel like a dog standin' on a toolbox
in the back of a pickup truck doin' 90 'round a corner
just tryin' to hang on for dear life
hangin' on it's what i live to do
you know i love this crazy life with you
remember when you quit your job to rodeo
or the time you jumped on stage to sing with the rolling stones
when you start rockin' i get ready to roll
sometimes i feel like a dog standin' on a toolbox
in the back of a pickup truck doin' 90 'round a corner
just tryin' to hang on for dear life
sometimes i feel like a dog standin' on a toolbox
in the back of a pickup truck doin' 90 'round a corner
just tryin' to hang on for dear life

and you're prayin' god takes you instead

just look at you sitting there
never looked better than tonight
and it'd be so easy to tell you i'd stay
like i've done so many times
i was so sure this would be the night
you'd close the door and wanna stay with me
and it'd be so easy to tell you i'd stay
like i've done so many times
don't fall in love with a dreamer
'cause he'll always take you in
just when you think you've really change him
he'll leave you again
don't you fall in love with a dreamer
'cause he'll break you every time
put out the light and just hold on
before we say goodbye
now it's morning and the phone rings
and you say you've gotta get your things together
you just gotta leave before you change your mind
and if you knew what i was thinking girl
i'd turn around if you'd just ask me one more time
don't fall in love with a dreamer
'cause he'll always take you in
just when you think you've really change him
he'll leave you again
don't you fall in love with a dreamer
'cause he'll break you every time
put out the light and just hold on
before we say goodbye 
eighteen years had come and gone 
for mama they flew by
but for me they drug on and on
we were loadin' up that chevy
both tryin' not to cry
mama kept on talkin' puttin' off goodbye
then she took my hand and said
baby don't forget
 before you hit the highway you better stop for gas
and there's a fifty in the ashtray in case you run short on cash
here's a map and here's a bible if you ever lose your way
just one more thing before you leave
don't forget to remember me 
this downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
and those bills there on the counter
keep tellin' me i'm on my own
just like every sunday i called mama up last night
and even when it's not i tell her everything's all right
before we hung up i said 
hey mama don't forget
 to tell my baby sister i'll see her in the fall
tell meemaw that i miss her yeah i should give her a call
and make sure that you tell daddy that i'm still his little girl
yeah i still feel like i'm where i'm supposed to be
but don't forget to remember me 
 tonight i find myself kneelin' by the bed to pray
haven't done this in a while so i don't know what to say
but lord i feel so small sometimes in this big old place
yeah i know there's more important things
but don't forget to remember me
don't forget to remember me  
i don't know when i've been so blue
don't know what's come over you
you've found someone new
and don't it make my brown eyes blue
i'll be fine when you're gone
i'll just cry all night long
say it isn't true
and don't it make my brown eyes blue
tell me no secrets tell me some lies
give me no reasons give me alibis
tell me you love me and don't let me cry
say anything but don't say goodbye
i didn't mean to treat you bad
didn't know just what i had
but honey now i do
and don't it make my brown eyes
don't it make my brown eyes
don't it make my brown eyes blue
tell me no secrets tell me some lies

my heart ain't ready
for the rolling stones
i don't feel like rockin'
since my baby's gone
so don't rock the jukebox
play me a country song
before you drop that quarter
keep one thing in mind
you got a heartbroke hillbilly
standing here in line
i've been down and lonely
ever since she left
before you punch that number
could i make one request
don't rock the jukebox
i wanna hear some jones
my heart ain't ready
for the rolling stones
i don't feel like rockin'
since my baby's gone
so don't rock the jukebox
play me a country song
i ain't got nothin'
against rock  roll
but when your heart's been broken
you need a song that's slow
ain't nothin' like a steel guitar
to drown a memory
before you spend your money baby
play a song for me
don't rock the jukebox
i wanna hear george jones
my heart ain't ready
for the rolling stones
i don't feel like rockin'
since my baby's gone
so don't rock the jukebox

chick rainstom shapiro
girl you've got me so confused
i don't know what i'm gonna do
part of me says take it slow
and part of me says let it go
don't  stop
don't  stop
don't stop doing what you're doing to me
i think we're moving way too fast
we need to take it slow and make it last
i can't keep holding back
when you keep doing things like that
don't  stop
don't  stop
don't stop doing what you're doing to me
but i've watched the flame of love go out
burning love takes a toll
i don't want to lose control
don't  stop
don't  stop
don't stop doing what you're doing to me 
i left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
swore i wasn't coming back said i'd had enough
saw you in the rear view standing fading from my life
but i wasn't turning round
no not this time
but don't think i don't think about it
don't think i don't have regrets
don't think it don't get to me
between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
don't think i don't wonder 'bout
could've been should've been all worked out
i know what i felt and i know what i said
but don't think i don't think about it
when we make choices we gotta live with them
heard you found a real good man and you married him
i wonder if sometimes i cross your mind
where would we be today
if i never drove that car away 
don't think i don't think about it
don't think i don't have regrets
don't think it don't get to me
between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
don't think i don't wonder 'bout
could've been should've been all worked out
yeah i know what i felt and i know what i said
but don't think i don't think about it
don't think i don't think about it
don't think i don't think about it
don't think i don't have regrets
don't think you don't get to me
between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
don't think i don't wonder 'bout
could've been should've been all worked out
i know what i felt and i know what i said
but don't think i don't think about it
no no don't think i don't
don't think i don't
mmmmmmm 
man you better let go
you can't hold on to
what belongs to me
and don't belong to you
i caught you looking
with your roving eye
so mister you don't have to act
so surprised
if it's her you want
i don't care about that
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
i grew up lonesome
on the open range
and that cold north wind
can make a man feel strange
my john b stetson
was my only friend
and we've stuck together
through many a woman
so if it's her you want
i don't care about that
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
my mama told me
son to be polite
take your hat off
when you walk inside
but the winds of change
they fill the air
and you can't set your hat down
just anywhere
so if you plead not guilty
i'll be the judge
we don't need no jury
to decide because
i wear a seven
and you're out of order
'cause i can tell from here
you're a seven and a quarter
but if it's her you want
i don't care about that
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
if it's her you want
i don't care about that
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
no it never complains
and it never cries
and it looks so good
and it fits just right
but if it's her you want
i don't care about that
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat
you can have my girl
but don't touch my hat

tried to figure out where this thing is going
baby baby dont dont you say youre leaving
why dont you stay a little bit longer
got it going on and i just cant believe it
this feeling it just keeps getting stronger
if you gotta go you gotta know i might go crazy

i can't understand why this is taking so long
somebody must have really done you wrong
cause every time i reach for you
you hold back and i'm so confused
how can you pull away from something so strong
somebody must have really done you wrong
he hurt you bad and your heart still aches
but why should we pay for his mistakes oh why
i don't know what he did but he's long gone
well he must have really done you wrong
'cause every time i reach for you
you hold back and i'm so confused
how can you pull away from something so strong
somebody must have really done you wrong
i wanna tear down
the walls that you built up
and baby open your heart
to all my love
every time i reach for you
you hold back and i'm so confused
how can you pull away from something so strong
somebody must have really really
somebody must have really done you wrong
somebody must have really done you wrong
somebody must have really done you wrong
done you wrong 
really really really done you wrong

saturday night and the moon is out
i wanna head on over to the twist and shout
find a twostep partner and a cajun beat
when it lifts me up i'm gonna find my feet
out in the middle of a big dance floor
when i hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
gonna dance to a band from alou'sian' tonight
well i never have wandered down to new orleans
never have drifted down a bayou stream
but i heard that music on the radio
and i swore some day i was gonna go
down highway 10 past lafayette
to baton rouge and i won't forget
to send you a card with my regrets
'cause i'm never gonna come back home

they got a alligator stew and a crawfish pie
a golf storm blowin' into town tonight
livin on the delta's quite a show
they got hurricane parties every time it blows
and here up north it's a cold cold rain
and there ain't no cure for my blues today
except when the paper says beausoleil is coming into town
baby let's go down

bring your mama bring your papa bring your sister too
they got lots of music and lots of room
when they play you a waltz from 1910
you gonna feel a little bit young again
well you learned to dance with your rock'n'roll
you learned to swing with a dosido
but you learn to love at the faissodo
when you hear a little jolie blon
 

i talked to your sister last night on the telephone
you know she always thought pretty well of me
she said that the wedding went fine and you were up in new york on your 
honeymoon
tonight i'm down in tennessee
i got that letter you wrote it tore me up
but i don't have anyone to blame but me
i had it all for a while but like everything else i messed it up
tonight i'm down in tennessee
it's blue tonight and getting bluer
but i'm in the state that i deserve to be
without you i just can't see things ever looking up for me
i'm so down in tennessee
i hope you're happy with him he's a lucky man
i hope he gives you that home and family
i just want to say if by chance you are ever this way look me up

without you i just can't see things ever looking up for me
i'm so down in tennessee

when i was a boy
four houses down from me
was a family with an only child
she was the only girl
in this whole world that could make me smile
down the road
i made up reasons to go
down the road
somewhere inside of me
there was something she took a liking to
and i asked her to marry me
and she said she really wanted to
down the road
to see what lifeís gonna hold
down the road
her momma wants to know
am i washed in the blood or just in the water
her daddy wants to know
if i make enough to take his daughter
down the road
before he can let her go
down the road
now down the street from here
thereís an engineer with an only son
and our baby girl says
she believes that he is the only one
down the road
her momma wants to know
is he washed in the blood or just in the water
and i want to know
if he makes enough to take my daughter
down the road
when it comes time to go
down the road
down the road
you know i want to help her go
down the road
down down down down that road
down down down down that road 

sweet dream babby sweet dream baby sweet dream baby how long must i dream

she left a yellow rose and a long neck bottle
on a table beside my bed
with a short little note that said i had a good time
it was written in lipstick red
she didn't sign her name i wonder
if that a little secret that she keeps
ohh she's walkin' around in my sleep
dream walkin' pillow talkin'
she's callin' my name again
day's breakin' i ain't wakin' up i'm sleepin' in
i'm on a roll now i gotta know how this dream ends
she took my new sunglasses and my old jean jacket
and she never even bothered to ask
you could say i haven't seen her since late last summer
but every night she comes back
just like smoke through the keyhole
she slips in so silently
ohh she's walkin' around in my sleep
dream walkin' pillow talkin'
she's callin' my name again
day's breakin' i ain't wakin' up i'm sleepin' in
i'm on a roll now i gotta know how this dream ends
ohh there's a thin line between dreams and memories
i'll be losin' my mind 'till she comes back to me
dream walkin' pillow talkin'
she's callin' my name again
day's breakin i ain't wakin' up i'm sleepin' in
i'm on a roll now i gotta know how this dream ends
i'm on a roll now i gotta know how this dream ends
i'm on a roll now i gotta know how this dream ends
she's walkin' around in my sleep
she's walkin' around in my sleep
yeah yeah 
she looks in the mirror and stares at the wrinkles that weren't there yesterday
and thinks of the young man that she almost married
what would he think if he saw her this way
she picks up her apron in little girl fashion as something comes into her mind
then slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
and all of the boys she had waiting in line
ah such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
you see everywhere anytime of the day
and everyday housewife who gave up the good time for me
the photograph album she takes from the closet and slowly turns the page
and carefully picks up the crumbling flower
the first one he gave her now withered with age
she closes her eyes and touches the housedress that suddenly disappears
and just for a moment she's wearing the gown
that broke all their minds back so many years
ah such are the dreams
ah such are the dreams
ah such are the dreams 




see that girl over there everyone thinks she's hot
and after a few your thinkin that you've got a shot
well maybe you do maybe you dont
but if you strike out there there hauss
and start telling yourself its her lose

thats just drinkin thinkin liquor logic in a can
your brian cells party and your body believes your supperman
thats just drinking thinkin
and here's where the trouble starts
the more you drink the better you think you are
from this stage and these lights
i see this stuff every night
a guy with a tie will challenge a biker to a fight
or the kareoke king who gets up to sing
an oldie and hears the applause
and beleives he can quit his day job

solo your getting better all the time
thats just drinkin thinkin liquor logic in a can
your brain cells party and your body believes your superman
thats just drinkin thinkin
and here's where the trouble starts
the more you think the better you drink you are
ah the bigger and badder smarter and better looking you think you are
you better switch to coffee 
it was painted red the stripe was white
it was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
secondhand from a dealer in atlanta
i rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
we put on a shine put on a motor
built out of love and made for the water
ran her for years til' the transom got rotten
a piece of my childhood will never be forgoten
it was just an old plywood boat
with a 75 johnson with electric choke
a young boy two hands on the wheel
i can't replace the way it made me feel
and i would turn her sharp
and i would make it whine
he'd say you can't beat the way a old wood boat rides
just a little lake cross the alabama line
but i was king of the ocean
when daddy let me drive
just an old half ton short bed ford
my uncle bought new in 64
daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
a couple of burnt valves and he had it going
he'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of thickpen road
i'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
smiling like a hero who just received his medal
it was just an old hand me down ford
with 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
a young boy two hands on the wheel
i can't replace the way it made me feel and 
i would press that clutch 
and i would keep it right
he would say a little slower son
your doing just fine
just a dirt road with trash on each side
but i was mario andretti
when daddy let me drive
i'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
i let them drive my old jeep
across the pasture at our home
maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
and pull out that old memory
and think of me and smile
and say
it was just an old worn out jeep
rusty old floor boards
hot on my feet
a young girl two hands on the wheel
i can't replace the way it made me feel
and he'd say
turn it left and steer it right
straighten up girl now you're doing just fine
just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
but i was high on a mountain
when daddy let me drive
daddy let me drive
oh he let me drive
it's just an old plywood boat
with a 75 johnson
and electric choke 






in my home town 
for anyone that sticks around 
you're either lost or you're found 
theres not much in between 
in my hometown 
everything's still black and white 
it's a long long way from wrong to right 
from sunday morning to saturday night 
everybody just wants to get high 
sit and watch the world go by 
we're all looking for love and meaning in our lives 
we follow the roads that lead us 
to drugs or jesus 
my whole life 
i tried to run i've tried to hide 
from the stained glass windows in my mind 
refusing to let god's light shine down on me 
down on me 
everybody just wants to get high 
sit and watch a perfect world go by 
we're all lookin' for love and meaning in our lives 
there's not much space between us
drugs or jesus 
everybody wants acceptance
we all want some proof 
everyone's just looking for the truth 
everybody just wants to get high 
sit and watch a perfect world go by 
we're all lookin' for love and meaning in our lives 
we follow the roads that leads us 
to drugs or jesus 
to drugs or jesus 
oh i need you jesus 
hallelujah 



creole williams lived down a dirt road
made homemade wine like nobody i know
dropped by one friday night and said 
can you help me creole
got a little girl waitin' on me and i wanna treat her right
i got what you need son it's sittin' down in the cellar
he reached through the cobwebs 
as he turned on the light and said
there might be a little dust on the bottle
but don't let it fool ya about what's inside
there might be a little dust on the bottle
it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
she was sittin in the porch swing as i pulled up the driveway
my ole heart was racing as she climbed inside
she slid over real close and drove down to the lake road
watched the sun fade in that big red sky
i reached under the front seat and said 
now here's something special
it's just been waiting for a night like tonight
there might be a little dust on the bottle
but don't let it fool ya about what's inside
there might be a little dust on the bottle
it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
you're still with me and we've made some memories
after all these years there's one thing i've found
some say good love well it's like a fine wine
it keeps getting better as the days go by
there might be a little dust on the bottle
but don't let it fool ya about what's inside
there might be a little dust on the bottle
it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
there might be a little dust on the bottle
but don't let it fool ya about what's inside
there might be a little dust on the bottle
it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
don't let it fool ya 
i am the eagle i live in high country
in rocky cathedrals that reach to the sky
i am the hawk and there's blood on my feathers
but time is still turning they soon will be dry
and all of those who see me and all who believe in me
share in the freedom i feel when i fly
come dance with the west wind and touch on the mountain tops
sail o'er the canyons and up to the stars
and reach for the heavens and hope for the future
and all that we can be and not what we are 
east bound and down loaded up and truckin' 
we gonna do what they say can't be done 
we've got a long way to go and a short time to get there 
i'm east bound just watch ol' bandit run 
keep your foot hard on the peddle son never mind them brakes 
let it all hang out 'cause we've got a run to make 
the boys are thirsty in atlanta and there's beer in texarkana 
and we'll bring it back no matter what it takes 
 
old smokey's got them ears on he's hot on your trail 
and he ain't gonna rest 'til you're in jail 
so you gotta dodge him you gotta duck him 
you gotta' keep that diesel truckin' 
just put that hammer down and give it hell 
 
charlie's got a gold watch
don't seem like a whole lot
after thirty years of driving up and down the interstate
but charlie's had a good life 
and charlie's got a good wife
and after tonight she'll no longer be counting the days
eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
ten more miles on his fourday run
a few more songs from the allnight radio
then he'll spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves
they'll buy a winnebago
set out to find america
they'll do a lot of catching up a little at a time
with pieces of the old dream
they're gonna light the old flame
doing what they please leaving every other reason behind
eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
ten more miles on his fourday run
a few more songs from the allnight radio
then he'll spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves
eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
ten more miles on his fourday run
a few more songs from the allnight radio
then he'll spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves 
out in the west texas town of el paso
i fell in love with a mexican girl
nighttime would find me in rosa's cantina
music would play and felina would whirl
blacker than night were the eyes of felina
wicked and evil while casting a spell
my love was deep for this mexican maiden
i was in love but in vain i could tell
one night a wild young cowboy came in
wild as the west texas wind
dashing and daring
a drink he was sharing
with wicked felina
the girl that i loved
so in anger i
challenged his right for the love of this maiden
down went his hand for the gun that he wore
my challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
the handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
just for a moment i stood there in silence
shocked by the foul evil deed i had done
many thoughts raced through my mind as i stood there
i had but one chance and that was to run
out through the back door of rosa's i ran
out where the horses were tied
i caught a good one
it looked like it could run
up on its back
and away i did ride
just as fast as i
could from the west texas town of el paso
out to the badlands of new mexico
back in el paso my life would be worthless
everything's gone in life nothing is left
it's been so long since i've seen the young maiden
my love is stronger than my fear of death
i saddled up and away i did go
riding alone in the dark
maybe tomorrow
a bullet may find me
tonight nothing's worse than this
pain in my heart
and at last here i
am on the hill overlooking el paso
i can see rosa's cantina below
my love is strong and it pushes me onward
down off the hill to felina i go
off to my right i see five mounted cowboys
off to my left ride a dozen or more
shouting and shooting i can't let them catch me
i have to make it to rosa's back door
something is dreadfully wrong for i feel
a deep burning pain in my side
though i am trying
to stay in the saddle
i'm getting weary
unable to ride
but my love for
felina is strong and i rise where i've fallen
though i am weary i can't stop to rest
i see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
i feel the bullet go deep in my chest
from out of nowhere felina has found me
kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
cradled by two loving arms that i'll die for
one little kiss and felina goodbye 
eyes that look like heaven lips like sherry wine 
that girl can sure enough make my little light shine 
i get a funny feelin' up and down my spine 
'cause i know that my elvira's mine 
so i'm singin' 
elvira elvira 
my heart's on fire elvira 
giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow 
giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow 
heighho silver away 
tonight i'm gonna meet her at the hungry house cafe 
and i'm gonna give her all the love i can 
she's gonna jump and holler 'cause i saved up my last two dollars 
we're gonna search and find that preacher man 
now i'm a singin' 
elvira elvira 
my heart's on fire elvira 
giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow 
giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow 
heighho silver away 
the winter months left us the snowfall
a black spring brought forth the rain
the summer days were long and dusty
by the fall your mind was made
and i recall we were lovers
they'll always be the good old days
the world back then was something simple
we laughed and danced in fond embrace
but people change like seasons do
this life we live is an open door
that was the fate of me and you
may you find what you're looking for
i never meant to hold you down
i've only found the words to say
it's plain to see that you were restless
i'm glad i stepped out of the way
i'll never know these endless seasons
i only see the way things are
we can only go on living
all the answers lie written in the stars
we gcan only go on loving
all the answers lie written in the stars
i'll never know these endless seasons
all the answers lie written in the stars 

you could've bowed out gracefully
but you didn't
you knew enough to know
to leave well enough alone
but you wouldn't
i drive myself crazy
tryin' to stay out of my own way
the messes that i make
but my secrets are so safe
the only one who gets me
yeah you get me
it's amazing to me

how every day
every day every day
you save my life
i come around all broken down and
crowded out
and you're comfort
sometimes the place i go
is so deep and dark and desperate
i don't know i don't know

sometimes i swear i don't know if
i'm comin' or goin'
but you always say something
without even knowin'
that i'm hangin' on to your words
with all of my might and it's alright
yeah i'm alright for one more night
every day
every day every day every day
every day every day
you save me you save me oh oh oh
every day
every every every day
every day you save my life 

i hear songs on the radio
they might be fast or they might be slow
but every song they play's got be thinkin' bout you
i see a fella walking down the street
he looks at me and he smiles so sweet
but he don't matter to me
'cause i'm thinkin' 'bout you
every little dream i dream about you
every little thought i think about you
it drives me crazy when you go away
i oughta keep you locked up at home
and like a wild horse i wanna break you
i love you so much i hate you
every little thing reminds me of you
honey when you leave me here all alone
my tongue gets tied when i try to talk
my knees get weak when i start to walk
so i might as well stay home
and keep thinkin' 'bout you
the young and restless on my tv set
that's just like us when we first met
and when they start to kissin'
got me thinkin' 'bout you
every little dream i dreamx2 
country roads old theatre marquee signs
parkin' lots and billboards flyin' by
spanish mosques little hick town squares
wild roses on a river bank girl its almost like you're there 
oh every mile a memory every song another scene
from some old movie going back in time you and me
every day a page turned down every night a lonesome sound
like a freight train rollin' through my dreams
every mile a memory
red sun down out across the western sky
takes me back to the fire in your eyes
texas stars in a purple night
not seein' 'em with you baby oh they never do it right no
every mile a memory every song another scene
from some old movie going back in time you and me
every day a page turned down every night a lonesome sound
like a freight train rollin' through my dreams
every mile a memory
funny how no matter where i run
round every bend i only see
just how far i haven't come 
every mile a memory every song another scene
from some old movie going back in time
every day a page turned down every night a lonesome sound
like a freight train rollin' through my dreams
every mile a memory
every mile a memory
every mile a memory

run your car off the side of the road
get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
or get yourself in a bind 
lose the shirt off your back
need a floor need a couch need a bus fare
this is where the rubber meets the road
this is where the cream is gonna rise
this is what you really didn't know
this is where the truth don't lie
you find out who your friends are
somebody's gonna drop everything
run out and crank up their car
hit the gas get there fast
never stop to think 
what's in it for me 
or it's way too far 
they just show on up
with their big ol' heart
you find out who your friends are
everybody wants to slap your back
wants to shake your hand 
when you're up on top of that mountain
but let one of those rocks give way
then you slide back down
look up and see who's around then
this ain't where the road comes to an end
this ain't where the bandwagon stops
this is just one of those times when
a lot of folks jump off
you find out who your friends are
somebody's gonna drop everything
run out and crank up their car
hit the gas get there fast
never stop to think
what's in it for me
or it's way too far 
they just show on up
with their big ol' heart
you find out who your friends are
when the water's high
when the weather's not so fair
when the well runs dry
who's gonna be there
you find out who your friends are
somebody's gonna drop everything
run out and crank up their car
hit the gas get there fast

lazy yellow moon comin' up tonite 
shinin' thru the trees 
crickets are singin' and lightning bugs 
are floatin on the breeze 
baby get ready 
across the field where the creek turns back by the ole stone road 
i'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows 
baby get readyooooooooooo 
you and me going fishing in the dark 
lying on our backs and counting the stars 
where the cool grass grows 
down by the river in the full moon light 
we'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night 
just movin' slow 
stayin' the whole night thru feels so good to be with you 
spring is almost over and the summer's comin'
the days are gettin' long 
waited all winter for the time to be right just to take you along 
baby get ready 
and it don't matter if we sit forever and the fish don't bite 
jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night 
baby get readyooooooooooo
repeat the  x3 
you and me going fishin in the dark 





it's by far the hardest thing i've ever done
to be so in love with you and so alone
follow me where i go what i do who i know
make it part of you to be a part of me
follow me up and down
all the way and all around
take my hand and say you'll follow me
it's long been on my mind
you know it's been a long long time
i've tried to find the way that i can make you understand
the way i feel about you 
and just how much i need you
to be there where i can talk to you 
when there's no one else around
follow me where i go what i do who i know
make it part of you to be a part of me
follow me up and down
all the way and all around
take my hand and say you'll follow me
you see i'd like to share my life with you
and show you things i've seen
places that i'm going to
places where i've been 
to have you there beside me 
to never be alone
and all the time that you're with me
we will be at home
follow me where i go what i do who i know
make it part of you to be a part of me
follow me up and down
all the way
take my hand and i will follow you 
i hear the train a comin'
it's rolling round the bend
and i ain't seen the sunshine since i don't know when
i'm stuck in folsom prison and time keeps draggin' on
but that train keeps a rollin' on down to san antone
when i was just a baby my mama told me son
always be a good boy don't ever play with guns
but i shot a man in reno just to watch him die
when i hear that whistle blowin' i hang my head and cry
i bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
they're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
well i know i had it coming i know i can't be free
but those people keep a movin'
and that's what tortures me
well if they freed me from this prison
if that railroad train was mine
i bet i'd move it on a little farther down the line
far from folsom prison that's where i want to stay
and i'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away 
it seems like all my life
i've never been satisfied
ain't nothin' i ain't tried
takin' every kind of line
tryin' to find my home on the range
been close a time or two
to seein' that dream come true
but i never could follow through
couldn't drop the other shoe
'cause pretty soon i knew
i'd be lookin' for a change
for a change
i can see a little sunlight
shinin' through the pourin' rain
i swear it's gettin' a little brighter
every time you call my name
you know i could get used to this
but right now it still feels strange
to be a happy man
i'm talkin' 'bout a happy man
i'm a happy man
for a change
girl i must confess
i live for your caress
every single time we kiss
i know that i've been blessed
i wanna share the same address
and that's where i wanna remain
goodbye o' wonder lust
i been there long enough
those times they sure are tough
things sure are lookin' up
ever since i found your love
i ain't lookin' for a change
for a change
i can see a little sunlight
shinin' through the pourin' rain
i swear it's gettin' a little brighter
every time you call my name
you know i could get used to this
a little home on the range
i'm a happy man
darlin' you made me a happy man
i'm a happy man
for a change
for a change 
sponsor 
i'll walk in the rain by your side
i'll cling to the warmth of your hand
i'll do anything to keep you satisfied
and i'll love you more than anybody can
and the wind will whisper your name to me
little birds will sing along in time
leaves will bow down when you walk by
and morning bells will chime
i'll be there when you're feeling down
to kiss away the tears if you cry
i'll share with you all the happiness i've found
a reflection of the love in your eyes
and i'll sing you the songs of the rainbow
a picture of the joy that is mine
the leaves will bow down when you walk by
and morning bells will chime
i'll walk in the rain by your side
i'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand
i'll do anything to help you understand
and i'll love you more than anybody can
and the wind will whisper your name to me
little birds will sing along in time
the leaves will bow down when you walk by
and morning bells will chime 
there were no angry words at all 
as we carried boxes down the hall
one by one we put them in your car
nothing much for us to say
one last goodbye and you drove away 
i watched your taillights as they faded in the dark
i couldn't face the night in that lonely bed 
so i laid down on the couch instead 
 last night i prayed the lord my soul to keep 
then i cried myself to sleep
so sure life wouldn't go on without you
but oh this sun is blinding me
as it wakes me from the dark
i guess the world didn't stop 
for my broken heart 
clocks still tickin' life goes on 
radio still plays a song
as i try to put my scattered thoughts in place 
and it takes all the strength i've got
to stumble to the coffee pot
the first of many lonely mornings i have to face 
you call to see if i'm ok
i look out the window and i just say 
 last night i prayed the lord my soul to keep 
then i cried myself to sleep
so sure life wouldn't go on without you
lord this sun is blinding me
as it wakes me from the dark
i guess the world didn't stop 
for my broken heart 
oh i guess the world ain't gonna stop 
for my broken heart 

don't look so sad i know it's over
but life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
there's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine
hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
and make believe you love me one more time for the good times
i'll get along you'll find another
and i'll be here if you should find you ever need me
don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
there'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
lay your head upon my pillow 
you may think that im talking foolish
youve heard that im wild  im free
you may wonder how i can promise you now
this love that im feeling for you always will be
youre not this time that im killing
im no longer one of those guys
as sure as i live this love that i give
is gonna be yours till the day that i die  oh baby

im gonna love you forever forever  ever amen
as long as old men sit  talk about the weather
as long as old women sit  talk about old men
if you wonder how long ill be faithfull
ill be happy to tell you again
im gonna love you forever  ever forever  ever amen
they say that time takes its toll on a body
makes the young girls brown hair turn grey
but honey i dont care im not in love with your hair
and if it all fell out well id love you anyway
they say that time can play tricks on a memory
and people forget things that they knew
but its easy to see its happening to me
ive already forgotten every woman but you  oh baby

just listen to how this song ends
im gonna love you forever  ever forever  ever
forever  ever forever  ever amen 
in your arms i can still feel the way you want me when you hold me
i can still hear the words you whispered when you told me
i can stay right here forever in your arms
and there ain't no way  i'm letting you go now
and there ain't no way  and there ain't no how
i'll never see the day
ëcause i'm keeping you forever and for always

i can still feel the way you want
the one who wouldn't put anything else in the world above me
i can still see love for me
i can still see love for me in your eyes
i still see the love
and there ain't no way  i'm letting you go now
and there ain't no way  and there ain't no how
i'll never see the day
ëcause i'm keeping you forever and for always
we will be together all of our days
wanna wake up every morning to your face  always
ëcause i'm keeping you forever and for always
we will be together all of our days
wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face  always
i'm keeping you forever and for always
i'm in your arms 
in your arms i can still feel the way you want me when you hold me
i can still hear the words you whispered when you told me
i can stay right here forever in your arms
and there ain't no way  i'm letting you go now
and there ain't no way  and there ain't no how
i'll never see the day
ëcause i'm keeping you forever and for always

ëcause i'm keeping you forever and for always
we will be together all of our days
wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face  always
i'm keeping you forever and for always
i'm in your arms 
i'll admit i could feel it 
the first time that we touched
the look in your eyes
said you felt as much 
but i'm not a man 
who falls so easily 
it's best that you know
where you stand with me
i will give you my heart
faithful and true
and all the love it can hold
that's all i can do 
but i've thought about 
how long i'll love you
and it's only fair that you know
forever's as far as i'll go
when there's age around my eyes 
and gray in your hair
and it only takes a touch to recall 
the love we've shared
i won't take for granted
that you know my love is true
each night in your arms
i will whisper to you
i will give you my heart
faithful and true
and all the love it can hold
that's all i can do 
but i've thought about 
how long i'll love you 
and it's only fair that you know
forever's as far as i'll go 
forgiving you was easyforgeting seems to take the longest time
i just keep thinking and your memory is forever on my mind
you know i'll aways love you and i can't forget the day when you were mine
forgiving you was easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
the bitter fruit of anger growing from the seeds of jealousy
oh what a heart ache but i forgive the things you said to me
for i believe forgiving is the only way i'll find peace of mind
forgiving you was easy but forgeting seems to take the longest time
the years have past so quickly
as once again they've sealed a young man's dream of all the golden years 
and growing old together you and me
you ask me to forgive you 
you said there was another on your mind
forgiving you was easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time 
now after all this
time your standing at my door
just when i cleared
my mind your coming back for more
well it doesn't work
that way you see i'm over you
and nowthere's nothin
left to say just find someone new
40 days and 40 nights
the rain came pouring down
40 day and 40 nights
no dry land to be found
torrents of rushing water
birds in endless flight
oh nowhere to found
40 days and nights
well i gotta go see i'm
real short of time
it would be nice i know
but see i've read between
the lines
and hey don't you look
so sad it wasn't easy
for me too
and don't worry
it's not that bad
to find someone new
40 days and 40 nights
the rain came pouring down
40 day and 40 nights
no dry land to be found
torrents of rushing water
birds in endless flight
oh nowhere to found
40 days and nights
40 days and nights
40 days and nights 

pair of boots and a sack of clothes
free and easy down the road i go
hangin' memories on the high line poles
free and easy down the road i go
free and easy down the road i go
ragweed's rockin' on the radio
free and easy down the road i go
so i keep rollin' like an old banjo
free and easy down the road i go
got the sun shinin' on me like a big spotlight
so i know everything is gonna be alright
ain't no tellin' where the wind might blow
free and easy down the road i go
livin' life like a sunday stroll
free and easy down the road i go
free and easy down the road i go
if you only get to go around one time
i'm gonna sit back and try to enjoy the ride
i could make a million or wind up broke
free and easy down the road i go
can't take it with you when you go so
free and easy down the road i go
someday i know it's gonna take me home so
free and easy down the road i go
free and easy down the road i go

and i toasted you said honey we may be through
but you'll never hear me complain
'cause i've got friends in low places
where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
my blues away and i'll be ok
and i'm not big on social graces

and i'll show myself to the door

that you're living in
'cause i've got friends in low places

galveston oh galveston
i still hear your sea winds blowing
i still see her dark eyes glowing
she was 21
when i left galveston
galveston oh galveston
i still hear your sea waves crashing
while i watch the cannons flashing
i clean my gun
and dream of galveston
i still see her standing by the water
standing there looking out to sea
and is she waiting there for me
on the beach where we used to run
galveston oh galveston
i am so afraid of dying
before i dry the tears she's crying
before i watch your sea birds flying in the sun
at galveston at galveston 
on a warm summer's evenin'
on a train bound for nowhere
i met up with the gambler
we were both too tired to sleep
so we took turns astarin'
out the window at the darkness
when boredom overtook us
he began to speak
he said son i've made my life
out of readin' people's faces
knowin' what the cards were
by the way they held their eyes
so if you don't mind my sayin'
i can see you're out of aces
for a taste of your whiskey
i'll give you some advice
so i handed him my bottle
and he drank down my last swallow
then he bummed a cigarette
and asked me for a light
and the night got deathly quiet
and his face lost all expression
he said if
you're gonna play the game boy
you gotta learn to play it right
you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your money
when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time enough for countin'
when the dealin's done
now every gambler knows
the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away
and knowin' what to keep
'cause every hand's a winner
and every hand's a loser
and the best you can hope for
is to die in your sleep
and when he finished speakin'
he turned back toward the window
crushed out his cigarette
and faded off to sleep
and somewhere in the darkness
the gambler he broke even
and in his final words i found
an ace that i could keep
you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your money
when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time enough for countin'
when the dealin's done
you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your money
when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time enough for countin'
when the dealin's done 
on a warm summer's evenin'

then he bummed a cigarette
and asked me for a light
and the night got deathly quiet
and his face lost all expression
he said if
you're gonna play the game boy
you gotta learn to play it right
you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your money
when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time enough for countin'
when the dealin's done
now every gambler knows
the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away
and knowin' what to keep
'cause every hand's a winner
and every hand's a loser
and the best you can hope for
is to die in your sleep
and when he finished speakin'
he turned back toward the window
crushed out his cigarette
and faded off to sleep
and somewhere in the darkness
the gambler he broke even
and in his final words i found
an ace that i could keep
you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your money
when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time enough for countin'
when the dealin's done
you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your money
when you're sittin' at the table
there'll be time enough for countin'
when the dealin's done 
it's knowing that your door is always open
and your path is free to walk
that makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
rolled up and stashed behind your couch
and it's knowing i'm not shackled
by forgotten words and bonds
and the ink stains that are dried upon some line
that keeps you in the backroads
by the rivers of my memory
that keeps you ever gentle on my mind
it's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
planted on their columns now that bind me
or something that somebody said
because they thought we fit together walking
it's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
or forgiving when i walk along some railroad track and find 
that you're moving on the backroads
by the rivers of my memory
and for hours you're just gentle on my mind
though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
and the junkyards and the highways come between us
and some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and i was gone
i still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
and the summer sun might burn me 'til i'm blind
but not to where i cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
by the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
i dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
cracklin' caldron in some train yard
my beard a rustling cold towel and
a dirty hat pulled low across my face
through cupped hands 'round the tin can
i pretend to hold you to my breast and find
that you're waiting from the backroads
by the rivers of my memories
ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind 
georgia georgia the whole day through
an' just an old sweet song keeps georgia on my mind
georgia georgia a song of you
comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines 
other arms reach out to me 
other eyes smile tenderly 
still in peaceful dreams i see 
the road leads back to you
georgia georgia no peace i find 
just an old sweet song keeps georgia on my mind

georgia georgia no peace i find 
just an old sweet song keeps georgia on my mind
just an old sweet song keeps georgia on my mind
on my mind
on my mind
on my mind
on my mind
on my mind
on my mind
on my mind
to fade out

she turned 15 with great expectations
her older brother knew that somethin' was up
he caught her going through his record collection
lookin' at hendrix like a lovesick pup
she begged and she pleaded 'till dad finally listened
he drove in the car down to sears roebuck
he bought her that guitar and that was the beginning
now she's down in the cellar with the amp turned up
girls with guitars
daddy's little angel
girls with guitars
what's the world coming to
girls with guitars
mothers tend to worry about
girls with guitars
well saturday nights she followed her brother
it was socks and stockings on the old gym floor
while everybody danced to garage band covers
she was checking out riffs and memorizing chords
she didn't care at all for the football heroes
she didn't even notice the basketball stars
boys as a species were all a bunch of zeroes
except for the ones that played that guitar
girls with guitars
she wasn't any debutante
girls with guitars
she didn't go out for cheerleading
girls with guitars
boys are kind of nervous 'round
girls with guitars
she went off to college
she got her degree
her parents breathed a sigh of great relief
daddy's thinking law school
mother's thinking medicine
daughter's thinking how she gonna break the news to them
now there's an old chevy van just sitting in the driveway
filled to the gills with all of her stuff
she cut a deal with her brother to drive it up the highway
she figures new york city is close enough
she gets the audition through a friend of a friend
who's checking out her legs saying this will never work
she flips on her boogie and turns to the band
gives a little grin and blows away the jerk
girls with guitars
now everybody's rockin'
girls with guitars
there ought to be a song about
girls with guitars
there's no just no stopping those
girls with guitars
get your money for nothin' and your guys for free 
she was stormin' through the house that day
an' i could tell she was leavin'
an' i thought aw she'll be back
till she turned around an' pointed at the wall an said 
that picture from our honeymoon
that night in frisco bay
just give it away
she said give it away
an' that big fourposter kingsize bed
where so much love was made
just give it away
she said just give it away 
just give it away
there ain't nothin' in this house worth fightin' over
oh an' we're both tired of fightin' anyway
so just give it away 
so i tried to move on
but i found that each woman i held
just reminded me of that day
hmmm 
when that front door swung wide open
she flung her diamond ring
said give it away
just give it away
an' i said now honey don't you even want
your half of everything
she said give it away
just give it away
just give it away
there ain't nothin' in this house worth fightin' over
oh an' we're both tired of fightin' anyway
so just give it away
so i'm still right here where she left me
along with all the other things
she don't care about anymore
mmmm 
like that picture from our honeymoon
that night in frisco bay
she said give it away
well i can't give it away
an' that big fourposter kingsize bed
where all our love was made
she said give it away
well i can't give it away
i've got a furnished house a diamond ring
an' a lonely broken heart
full of love
an' i can't even give it away 

i caught you glancing in a pawn shop window
you caught me looking there too
just a little quartercarat diamond
but it was sparkling true
i could see you were a little uneasy
you said we're running late
and later on parked over in my driveway
said boy you're gonna have to wait
if you really wanna be my baby
i really want you to be mine all mine
if you wanna talk about forever 
that's what's on my mind
give me a ring sometime
i always love the little things you give me
gentle roses and sweet perfume
i was thrilled the first time you kissed me
but just a little too soon
where i come from love stands for something
and it's worth the wait
baby i'm a little oldfashioned
but maybe that's okay
if you really wanna be my baby
i really want you to be mine all mine
if you wanna talk about forever 
that's what's on my mind
give me a ring sometime
don't keep my heart on the line
if you really wanna be my baby
i really want you to be mine all mine
if you wanna talk about forever 
that's what's on my mind
give me a ring sometime
give me a ring sometime
give me a ring sometime 
i've seen a lot of places
i've been around the world
i've seen pretty faces
been with some beautiful girls
after all i've witnessed
one thing still amazes me
just like a miracle you have to see to believe

cause god blessed texas
with his own hand
brought down angels from the promised land
gave 'em a place where they could dance
if you wanna see heaven brother here's you chance
i've been sent to spread the message
god blessed texas
first he let the sun shine
then he made the waters deep
then he gave us moonlight
for all the world to see
well everybody knows that the lord works in mysterious ways
he took a rest then on the very next day
 x2
well i've been sent to spread the message
god blessed texas
well i've been sent to spread the message

just a girl born in dixie 
washed in the blood 
and raised on the banks 
of the mississippi mud 
she always had a thing 
about fallin' in love with a bad boy 
yea they could see it all comin' 
but her daddy never dreamed 
she'd grow up that fast 
you know what i mean 
the way a girl gets 
when she turns 17 
kinda crazy 
she's a rebel child 
and a preacher's daughter 
she was baptized in dirty water 
her mama cried the first time 
they caught her with me 
they knew they couldn't stop her 
she holds tight to me and the bible 
on the back seat of my motercycle 
left her daddy standin' there 
preachin' to the choir 
you seegod love her 
oh me and god love her 
she kissed her mama goodbye 
said i'll be sure 'n phone ya 
she called from a truck stop 
in tucson arizona 
with amazing grace 
we made california line 
and then my gypsy life 
started takin' it's toll 
and the fast lane got empty 
and out of control 
and just like an angel 
she saved my soul from the devil 
yea she's a rebel child 
and a preacher's daughter 
she was baptized in dirty water 
her mama cried the first time 
they caught her with me 
they knew they couldn't stop her 
she holds tight to me and the bible 
on the back seat of my motercycle 
left her daddy standin' there 
preachin' to the choir 
you seegod love her 
oh me and god love her 
now she holds tight to me and the bible 
on the back seat of my motercycle

that anchor man
says the fight began
somewhere in the middle east
the world prays for peace
there's a single mom
just got laid off when she lost a job
to some foreign hands
in some faraway land
last night in oklahoma
some twister took thirteen
and they're praying that they find
the missing three

that highway sign
went from slow ahead
to traffic's dead
thought it couldn't get worse
than that amber alert
they say she's 4
colorado plates headed outofstate
in a chevy van
it's hard to understand
you can see it in the faces
of all those highway strangers
they're praying that god
keeps that girl from danger
god must be busy
and i know in the big picture
i'm just a speck of sand
and god's got better things to do
than look out for one man
i know he's heard my prayers
cause he hears everything
he just ain't answered back
or he'd bring you back to me
god must be busy
that evening news
ain't much changed
pretty much the same
since i left home
yeah that war's still on
they found that little girl
she was soaking wet
half scared to death
on the side of some road

and the bloods and cripps are at it
and theres a killer drought down south
and old folks can't afford the drugs
they can't live with out
god must be busy
and i know in the big picture

or he'd bring you back to me
god must be busy
that anchorman
says the fightings worse
cities burn in the middle east

six short months we went together

two paychecks are better than one
a diamond ring and it was done

in subdivided neighborhood
the fuse got short and the nights got long

i'm goin' through the big d
and don't mean dallas
things like this are never final
i'm still payin' on the vinyl
flooring in the laundry room
it's multicolored and waterproof
it's a little bit tough to face my friends
the ones that said i jumped in
the river of love a little too soon
that was august
this is june and it's a different tune
i'm goin' through the big d
and don't mean dallas
i can't believe what the judge had to tell us
i got the jeep she got the palace
i'm goin' through the big d
and don't mean dallas
i'm goin' through the big d
and don't mean dallas
i can't believe what the judge had to tell us

george jones  tammy wynette
in a pawn shop in chicago 
on a sunny summer day
a couple gazes at the 
wedding rings there on display
she smiles and nods her head 
as he says honey that's for you
it's not much but it's the best that i can do
golden ring with one tiny little stone 
waiting there for someone to take it home
by itself it's just a cold metalic thing
only love can make a golden wedding ring 
in a little wedding chapel 
later on that after noon
an old up right piano 
plays that old familiar tune
tears roll down her cheeks 
and happy thoughts run through her head
as he whispers low with this ring i thee wed
golden ring with one tiny little stone 
shining ring now at last it's found a home
by itself it's just a cold metalic thing
only love can make a golden wedding ring
in a small two room apartment 
as they fight their final round
he says tou won't admit it 
but i know you're leavin' town
she says one thing's for certain 
i don't love you anymore
and throws down the ring 
as she walks out the door
golden ring with one tiny little stone 
cast aside like the love that's dead and gone
by itself it's just a cold metalic thing
only love can make a golden wedding ring
in a pawn shop in chicago 
on a sunny summer day
a couple gazes at the 
wedding rings there on display

here i am alone again tonight
in this old empty house
its hard to learn what you don't think you need
that you can't live without
never leave the sound of the telephone
but ever since you left
i've been gone
gone crazy 
going out of my mind
i've asked myself the reasons
atleast a thousand times
going up and down this hall way
trying to leave the pain behind
ever since you left
i've been gone
never saw your face this many times 
when you were really here
things you said i never understood
now crystal clear
never spent this much time alone
but ever since you left
i've been gone
gone crazy 
going out of my mind
i've asked myself the reasons
atleast a thousand times
going up and down this hall way
trying to leave the pain behind
ever since you left
i've been gone 2x
i've been gone repeat til end 


i was sittin' at sellin' turnips on a flatbed truck
crunchin' on a pork rind when she pulled up
she had to be thinkin' this is where rednecks come from
she had hollywood written on her license plate
she was lost and lookin' for the interstate
needin' directions and i was the man for the job
i told her way up yonder past the caution light
there's a little country store with an old coke sign
ya gotta stop in and ask mrs bill fer suma her sweet tea
then a left will take ya to the interstate
but a right will bring ya right back here to me
i was sittin' at thinkin' 'bout her pretty face
kickin' myself for not catchin' her name
i threw my hat and thought you fool it coulda been love
i knew my old ford couldn't run her down
she probably didn't like me anyhow
so i watched her disappear into a cloud of dust
i told her way up yonder past the caution light
there's a little country store with an old coke sign
ya gotta stop in and ask mrs bill fer suma her sweet tea
then a left will take ya to the interstate
but a right will bring ya right back here to me
is this georgia heat playin' tricks on me
or am i really seein' what i think i see
the woman of my dreams comin' back to me
she went way up yonder past the caution light
don't know what but somethin' felt right
when she stopped in and asked mrs bill fer suma her sweet tea
mama gave her a big 'ol glass and sent 'er right back her to me
thank god for good directions and turnip greens
written by heart from shelby harvey 

she's a goodhearted woman in love with a goodtimin' man
she loves him in spite of his wicked ways
she don't understand
through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass through this world hand in hand
she's a goodhearted woman loving a goodtimin' man
well a long time forgotten
dreams have just fell by the way
and the good life he promised
ain't what she's living today
but she never complains of the bad times
or bad things he's done
she just talks about the good times they've had
and all the good times to come
she's a goodhearted woman in love with a goodtimin' man
she loves him in spite of his wicked ways
she don't understand
through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass through this world hand in hand
she's a goodhearted woman loving a goodtimin' man
he likes the bright light the nite life
and goodtimin' friends
when the party's all over
she'll welcome him back home again
she don't understand him
but she does the best that she can
this goodhearted woman
lovin' a goodtimin' man
she's a goodhearted woman in love with a goodtimin' man
she loves me in spite of my wicked ways
she don't understand
through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass through this world hand in hand
she's a goodhearted woman loving a goodtimin' man
she's a goodhearted woman loving a goodtimin' man 
good morning beautiful how was your night
mine was wonderful with you by my side
and when i opened my eyes and see your sweet face
its a good morning beautiful day
i couldn't see the light
i didn't know day from night
i had no reason to care
well since you came along
i can face the dawn
cause i know you'll be there
good morning beautiful how was your night
mine was wonderful with you by my side
and when i opened my eyes and see your sweet face
its a good morning beautiful day
i never worry if it's raining outside
cause in here with you girl the sun always shines
good morning beautiful how was your night
mine was wonderful with you by my side
and when i opened my eyes and see your sweet face
its a good morning beautiful day
good morning beautiful day
it's a beautiful day
good morning day
what a beautiful day 
well me and my lady had our first big fight
so i drove around till i saw the neon lights
the corner bar
it just seemed right so i pulled up
not a soul around but the old bar keep 
down at the end lookin' half asleep 
he walked up and said what'll it be
i said the good stuff
he didn't reach around for the whiskey
he didn't pour me a beer
his blue eyes kind of went misty
he said you can't find that here
 1
cause its the first long kiss on a second date
your momma's all worried when you get home late
droppin the ring in the spaghetti plate
cause your hands are shakin so much
it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
and askin for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
yeah man that's the good stuff
he grabbed a carton of milk 
and he poured a glass
then i smiled and said
i'll have some of that
we sat there and talked as an hour passed
like old friends
saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
it was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
he said that's my bonnie taken 'bout a year after we wed
he said spent 5 years in the bottle when the cancer took her from me
but ive been sober 3 years now
'cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey
 2
was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl
the way she adored that string of pearls
i gave her the day that our youngest boy earl
married his high school love
and it's a new tshirt saying i'm a grandpa
and being right there as our time got small
and holdin her hand when the good lord called her up
yeah man that's the good stuff
bridge 
he said when you get home she'll start to cry
when she says im sorry say so am i 
then look into those eyes so deep in love
and drink it up
'cause thats the good stuff
that's the good stuff

it's five o'clock this morning and the sun is on the rise 
there's frosting on the window pane and sorrow in your eyes
the stars are fading quietly the night is nearly gone
and so you turn away from me and tears begin to come

and it's goodbye again i'm sorry to be leavin' you
goodbye again as if you didn't know it's goodbye again
and i wish you could tell me why do we always fight when i have to go
it seems a shame to leave you now
the days are soft and warm
i long to lay me down again and hold you in my arms 
i long to kiss the tears away give you back the smile
other voices beckon me to go a little while

i have to go and see some friends of mine
some that i don't know
some who aren't familiar with my name 
it's something that's inside of me not hard to understand
it's anyone who listens to me sing
and if you hours are empty now
who am i to blame
you think if i were always here our love would be the same
as it is the time we have is worth the time alone
and lying by your side the greatest peace i've ever known
but it's goodbye again 
and i'm sorry to be leavin' you goodbye again
as if you didn't know it's goodbye again
and i wish you could tell me 
why do we always fight when i have to go 
maryann and wanda were the best of friends
all through their high school days
both members of the 4h club
both active in the ffa
after graduation maryann went out lookin' for a bright new world
wanda looked all around this town and all she found was earl
well it wasn't two weeks after she got married
that wanda started gettin' abused
she put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
and makeup to cover a bruise
well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
she let the law take it from there
but earl walked right through that restraining order
and put her in intensive care
right away maryann flew in from atlanta
on a red eye midnight flight
she held wanda's hand as they worked out a plan
and it didn't take 'em long to decide 
that earl had to die
nanana
goodbye earl
those blackeyed peas nanana
they tasted all right to me earl
you feelin' weak nanana
why don't you lay down and sleep earl
ain't it dark nanana
wrapped up in that tarp earl
the cops came by to bring earl in
they searched the house high and low
then they tipped their hats and said 
thank you ladies if you hear from him let us know
well the weeks went by and
spring turned to summer
and summer faded into fall
and it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all
so the girls bought some land and a roadside stand 
out on highway 109
they sell tennessee ham and strawberry jam
and they don't lose any sleep at night 
'cause earl had to die
nanana
goodbye earl
we need a break
let's go out to the lake earl
we'll pack a lunch nanana
and stuff you in the trunk earl
well is that all right nanana
good 
let's go for a ride earl
hey nanana
oh hey hey hey nanana
aww hey hey hey nanana
wellhey hey hey nanana 


it's your life  you say you need a change
don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
you say it's different now and you keep staring at the door
how can you walk away don't i matter anymore
if being free's worth what you leave behind
and if it's too late for love to change your mind
then it's goodbye time
if we had known our love would come to this
we could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
well it's been fun  what else can i say
if the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway
if being free's worth what you leave behind
and if it's too late for love to change your mind
then it's goodbye time
   goodbye baby 
grandpa
tell me 'bout the good old days
sometimes it feels like
this world's gone crazy
grandpa take me back to yesterday
where the line between right and wrong
didn't seem so hazy
did lovers really fall in love to stay
stand beside each other come what may
was a promise really something people kept
not just something they would say
did families really bow their heads to pray
did daddies really never go away
whoa oh grandpa
tell me 'bout the good old days
musical interlude
grandpa
everything is changing fast
we call it progress
but i just don't know
and grandpa let's wonder back into the past
and paint me a picture of long ago
did lovers really fall in love to stay
stand beside each other come what may
was a promise really something people kept
not just something they would say and then forget
did families really bow their heads to pray
did daddies really never go away
whoa oh grandpa
tell me 'bout the good old days
whoa oh grandpa
tell me 'bout the good ole days
musical interlude

track 8  time 335
sally's puttin' on her perfume  slippin' into highheeled shoes
sally used to have a boyfriend play the blues
billy's puttin' gas in the pickup  combin' his hair just right
money burnin' holes in his pocket till tonight
'cause it's nine o'clock  time to rock
goin' downtown  gonna hear a little guitar talk
mama does her time at the factory
daddy minds the local store
nothin' much to say about it anymore
when they get lost in the music  under the dancehall lights
mama still makes lovin' daddy feel all right
'cause it's nine o'clock  time to rock
goin' downtown  gonna hear a little guitar talk
when the guitar talks when the bass man walks
there's a place down deep inside your heart it will unlock
when there's singin' strings and the guitar rings
everywhere around the world the message is the same
weatherman tells the weather  tv man reads the news
but there's nothin' like a fender talkin' 'bout blue suede shoes
and if your baby leaves you and if it's been a low down day
listen what a good old sixstring has to say
'cause it's nine o'clock  time to rock
goin' downtown  gonna hear a little guitar talk
all around the block  we're all gonna rock
goin' downtown  goona hear a little guitar talk
hear a little guitar talk
hear a little guitar talk
hear a little guitar talk
hear a little guitar talk 
hey pretty baby are you ready for me
it's your good rockin' daddy down from tennessee
i'm just out of austin bound for san antone
with the radio blastin' and the bird dog on
there's a speed trap up ahead in selma town
but no local yokel gonna shut me down
'cause me and my boys got this rig unwound
and we've come a thousand miles from a guitar town
nothin' ever happened 'round my hometown
and i ain't the kind to just hang around
but i heard someone callin' my name one day
and i followed that voice down the lost highway
everybody told me you can't get far
on thirtyseven dollars and a jap guitar
now i'm smokin' into texas with the hammer down
and a rockin' little combo from the guitar town
hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault
i love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt
wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
stumble in the restaurant wonderin' why i don't stop
well i gotta keep rockin' why i still can
i gotta two pack habit and a motel tan
but when my boots hit the boards i'm a brand new man
with my back to the riser i make my stand
and hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight
we're loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight
one of these days i'm gonna settle down
and take you back with me to the guitar town 
girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
and showed me how this town can shatter dreams
another lesson 'bout a naive fool who came to babylon
and found out that the pie don't taste so sweet
now it's guitars cadillacs hillbilly music
lonely lonely streets that i call home
yeah my guitars cadillacs hillbilly music
it's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
painful scars are all that's left of me
oh but thank you girl for teachin' me brand new ways to be cruel
if i can find my mind now i guess i'll just leave
and it's guitars cadillacs hillbilly music
lonely lonely streets that i call home
yeah my guitars cadillacs hillbilly music
it's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
oh it's guitars cadillacs hillbilly music
lonely lonely streets that i call home
yeah my guitars cadillacs hillbilly music
it's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
it's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
it's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on 

county road 233 under my feet
nothin' on this white rock but little ole me
i've got two miles till he makes bail
and if i'm right we're headed straight for hell
i'm goin' home gonna load my shotgun
wait by the door and light a cigarette
if he wants a fight well now he's got one
and he ain't seen me crazy yet
he slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
don't that sound like a real man
i'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
gunpowder and lead
well it's half past ten another six pack in
and i can feel the rumble like a cold black wind
he pulls in the drive the gravel flies
he don't know what's waiting here this time
i'm goin' home gonna load my shotgun
wait by the door and light a cigarette
if he wants a fight well now he's got one
and he ain't seen me crazy yet
he slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
don't that sound like a real man
i'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
gunpowder and lead
his fist is big but my gun's bigger
he'll find out when i pull the trigger
i'm goin' home gonna load my shotgun
wait by the door and light a cigarette
if he wants a fight well now he's got one
and he ain't seen me crazy yet
he slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
don't that sound like a real man
i'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
gunpowder and 
gunpowder and lead
gunpowder and lead 




i've seen it going around when you get bad news 
thinking that you found a darker shade of blues 
looking for the light and it's a long way back 
you know without a fight you're gonna fade to black 
never was a man that ever felt this way 
one who couldn't live to see another day 
hard times seem to have the corner on you 
but you can rise from the ashes too 
when i'm on my knees and everything has gotten me beat 
and even i believe i'm never gonna find my feet 
two ways you can go you can ask anybody around 
one man's half way up is another man's half way down 
now you may decide it's a losing game 
even in your stride you're gonna call it lame 
getting one leg up when it's said and done 
is the hardest part no matter how you run 
if you can walk away from a crash and burn 
you'll appreciate every step you earn 
and if you feel the ground is gaining on you 
you're already bound to take a different view 
when i'm on my knees and everything has gotten me beat 
and even i believe i'm never gonna find my feet 
two ways you can go you can ask anybody around 
one man's half way up is another man's half way down 
one man's ceiling is another man's floor 
one man's wall could be another man's door 
one man's smile is another man's frown 
and there are miles of half way up or half way down 





intro listen to recording for timing
since the day i was led to temptation
and in weakness did let your love down
i have prayed that with time and compassion
you'd come around

i keep waiting for you to forgive me
and you keep saying you can't even start
and i feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
to the hard rock bottom of your heart
to the hard rock bottom of your heart
now this home we have built is still standing
it's foundation is on solid ground
do we roll up our sleeves and repair it
or burn it down
go to 
we can't just block it out we've got to talk it out
until our hearts get back in touch
i need your love i miss it i can't go on like this is
hurts too much
go to  repeat last two lines of  for ending 

ronnie dunn
i'm a hard workin' man
i wear a steel hard hat
i can ride rope hammer and paint
do things with my hands that most men can't
i can't get ahead no matter how hard i try
i'm gettin' really good at barely gettin' by
got everything i own
by the sweat of my brow
from my fourwheel drive to my cowboy boots
i owe it all to my blue collar roots
i feel like i'm workin' overtime on a runaway train
i've got to bust loose from this ball and chain

i'm a hard hard workin man
i got it all on the line
for a peace of the promised land
i'm burnin' my candle at both ends
'bout the only way to keep the fire goin'
is to outrun the wind
come friday night
i like to party hard
i carry on with the cadillac cuties
spend my whole week's pay on some weekend beauty
come monday mornin' i'm the first to arrive
i ain't nothin' but business from nine till five

i can't wait to get up in the mornin'
and do it all over again
well i'm a hard livin' hard workin' man 
i was standing in line at the city bus stop
soaked to the skin from ev'ry rain drop
i see you driving by just like a phantom jet
with your arm around some little brunette
you say you won't be home because you're working late
honey i'm no fool you've been out on a date
the lipstick on your collar gives the game away
it's strawberry red and mine's pink rose

have mercy on me
you treat me so bad i'm in misery
it's breaking my heart can't you see
baby baby have mercy on me
well i called you up on the telephone
i could hear you was playin' haggard and jones
i knew right then that there was something wrong
there's only one reason you play cheatin' songs

went to the bank with my little check book
the cashier he gave me the strangest look
he said you ain't got no money 'cause you're over drawn
your man took it all and he's done gone
 
there was a time when i was in a hurry as you are
i was like you
there was a day when i just had to tell my point of view
i was like you
now i don't mean to make you frown
no i just want you to slow down
have you never been mellow
have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you
have you never been happy just to hear your song
have you never let someone else be strong
running around as you do with your head up in the clouds
i was like you
never had time to lay back kick your shoes off close your eyes
i was like you
now you're not hard to understand
you need someone to take your hand
have you never been mellow
have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you
have you never been happy just to hear your song
have you never let someone else be strong 
he's flying high tonight
he's got a brand new lover
here you come arunnin'
you're looking for some cover
i know you're sad and lonely
i know you're feeling blue
you miss him so much
won't let me get to close to you

oh he ain't worth missin'
oh we should be kissin'
stop all this foolish wishin'
he ain't worth missin'
i know your head is turnin'
i know your heart is burnin'
girl you gotta listen
don't you know he ain't worth missin'
you know i'm here to save you
but you ain't through cryin' yet
look at your pretty face
all red and soakin' wet
i'm gonna try to make him
just a memory
come on baby let's get started
first thing you got to see

oh he ain't worth missin'
oh we should be kissin'
stop all this foolish wishin'
he ain't worth missin'
i know your head is turnin'
i know your heart is burnin'
girl you gotta listen
don't you know he ain't worth missin'
if you need someone to hold you
someone to ease your pain
well i'll be holding steady
girl when you get ready
i'm gonna show you
love is a good thing
yeah love is a good thing

oh he ain't worth missin'
oh we should be kissin'
stop all that foolish wishin'
ooh the boy ain't worth missin'
i know your head is turnin'
i know your heart is burnin'
girl you gotta listen
don't you know he ain't worth missin'

oh he ain't worth missin'
oh we should be kissin'
stop all that foolish wishin'
he ain't worth missin'
i know your head is turnin'
i know your heart is burnin'
girl you gotta listen 
he said i'll love you 'til i die
she told him you'll forget in time
as the years went slowly by
she still preyed upon his mind
he kept her picture on his wall
went half crazy now and then
he still loved her through it all
hoping she'd come back again
found love letters by his bed
dated 19 and 62
he had underlined in red
every single i love you
i went to see my friend today
oh but i didn't see no tears
all dressed up to go away
first time i'd seen him smile in years
he stopped loving her today
they placed a wreath upon his door
and soon they'll carry him away
he stopped loving her today
spoken
ya' know she came to see him one last time
oh we all wondered if she would
and it kept running through my mind
this time he's over her for good
sang
he stopped loving her today
they placed a wreath upon his door
and soon they'll carry him away
he stopped loving her today
lyrics note there are several lyrical versions of this song
the only difference i can find is in the 3rd verse the 1st line
the alternate version reads kept some letters by his bed
another difference is in the 4th verse i went to see my
friend today may be found saying i went to see him just today

put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
lets pretend we're together all alone
i'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
and you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go
whisper to me tell me do you love me true
or is he holding you the way i do
though love is blind make up your mind i've got to know
should i hang up or will you tell him he'll have to go
you cant say the words i want to hear
while you're with another man
do you you want me answer yes or no
darling i will understand
put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
lets pretend that we're together all alone
i'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
and you can tell your friend there with you
he'll have to go 


i pay rent on a rundown place
there ain't no view but there's lots of space
in my heart the heart that you own
i pay the rent pay it right on time
baby i pay you ever single dime
for my heart the heart that you own
used to be i could love here for free
way back before you bought the property
now i pay daily on what once was mine
lord i probably owe you for these tears that i cry
'cause i pay rent on a rundown place
there ain't no view but there's lots of space
in my heart the heart that you own
i struggle each night to find a new way
to pay what i owe just so i can stay
i ain't overdue so you can't throw me out
i've loved here for years don't know where i'd go now
'cause i pay rent on a rundown place
there ain't no view but there's lots of space
in my heart the heart that you own
yea my heart the heart that you own 
heartache number one was when you left me
i never knew that i could hurt this way
and heartache number two was when you came back again
you came back and never meant to stay
now i've got heartaches by the number troubles by the score
every day you love me less each day i love you more
yes i've got heartaches by the number a love that i can't win
but the day that i stop counting that's the day my world will end
 steel 
heartache number three was when you called me
and said that you was coming back to stay
with hopeful heart i waited for your knock on the door
i waited but you must have lost your way
now i've got heartaches 




he works way too much for way too little
he drinks way too early till way too late
he hasn't had a raise since new year's day
in eightyeight gets trampled on by everyone
except when he comes in here
and he's the product of the haggard generation
he's got a redneck side when you get him agitated
he got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook
he's proud he took for his right wing stand on vietnam
says he lost his brother there
he yells out johnny cash
and the band starts to play
a ring of fire as he walks up
and stands there by the stage
and he says
hell yeah
turn it up
right on
hell yeah
sounds good
sing that song
guitar man playin' all night long
take me back to where the music hit me
life was good and love was easy
she's got an mba and a plush corner office
she's got a don't mess with me attitude
she'll close a deal she don't reveal that she can feel
the loneliness the emptiness
except when she comes in here
she's the product of the me generation
she's got a rock and roll side when you get her agitated
she got the tattoo there on her derriere from a spring break dare 
in panama where love was all she thought she'd ever need
she yells out to the band
know any bruce springsteen
then she jumps up on the bar
and she and she starts to scream
she says
hell yeah
turn it up
right on
hell yeah
sounds good
sing that song
guitar man playin' all night long
take me back to where the music hit me
when life was good and love was easy
yeah yeah

you waltz right in the door
just like you've done before
and wrap my heart 'round your little finger
here you come again
just when i'm about to make it work without you
you look into my eyes
and lie those pretty lies
and pretty soon i'm wonderin' how i came to doubt you
all you got to do is smile that smile
and there go all my defenses
just leave it up to you and in a little while
you're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
here you come again

there's a place i've been looking for
that took me in and out of buildings
behind windows walls and doors
and i thought i found it
couple times even settled down
and i'd hand around just long enough
to find my way back out
i know now the place that i was trying to reach
was you right here in front of me
and i wouldn't change a thing
i'd walk right back through the rain
back to every broken heart
on the day that it was breaking
and i'd relive all the years
and be thankful for the tears
i've cried with every stumbled step
that led to you and got me here right here
it's amazing what i let my heart go through
to get me where it got me
in this moment here with you
and it passed me by
god knows how many times
i was so caught up in holding
what i never thought i'd find
i know now there's a million roads
i had to take
to get me in your arms that way
and i wouldn't change a thing
i'd walk right back through the rain
back to every broken heart
on the day that it was breaking
and i'd relive all the years
and be thankful for the tears
i've cried with every stumbled step
that led to you and got me here right here
in a love i never thought i'd get to get to
here
and if that's the road
god made me take to be with you
and i wouldn't change a thing
i'd walk right back through the rain
back to every broken heart
on the day that it was breaking
and i'd relive all the years
and be thankful for the tears
i've cried with every stumbled step
that led to you and got me here right here
and i'd relive all the years
and be thankful for all the tears
i've cried with every stumbled step
that led to you and got me here right here
oh baby oh
oh got me here 
i ain't lived forever but i've lived enough
i've learned to be gentle and i've learned to be tough
i've found only two things that last 'til the end
one is your heroes the other's your friends

your heroes will help you find good in yourself
your friends won't foresake you for somebody else
they'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin
that's how it goes with heroes and friends
i grew up with cowboys i watched on tv
my friends and i sometimes pretended to be
years have gone by but now and again
my heart rides the range with my heroes and friends

playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun
keepin' up the rhythm steady as a clock
doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

as long as it's pumpin' honey it's gonna last
it's the hillbilly rock beat it with a drum
playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun
keepin' up the rhythm steady as a clock
doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

through the carolinas on them dirt red roads
burnin like a fire runnin' wild in the woods
from arkansas to texas it sounds so good
it's the hillbilly rock beat it with a drum
playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun
keepin' up the rhythm steady as a clock
doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock
so when the heat starts to risin' and you gotta blow some steam
take a ride down the river you'll see just what i mean
the juke joint's jumpin when that cat goes on
the whole place is shakin' there's a something goin' on
it's the hillbilly rock beat it with a drum
playin' them guitars like shootin from a gun
keepin' up the rhythm steady as a clock
doin' a little thing called the hillbilly rock

honeycomb
honeycomb
well it's a darn good life
and it's kinda funny
how the lord made the bee
and the bee made the honey
and the honeybee lookin' for a home
and they called it honeycomb
and they roamed the world and they gathered all
of the honeycomb into one sweet ball
and the honeycomb from a million trips
made my baby's lips
oh honeycomb won't you be my baby
well honeycomb be my own
got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
and made a walkin' talkin' honeycomb
well honeycomb won't you be my baby
well honeycomb be my own
what a darn good life
when you got a wife like honeycomb
honeycomb
and the lord said now that i made a bee
i'm gonna look all around for a green green tree
and he made a little tree and i guess you heard
oh then well he made a little bird
and they waited all around until the end of spring
gettin' every note that the birdie'd sing
and they put 'em all into one sweet tome
for my honeycomb
oh honeycomb won't you be my baby
well honeycomb be my own
got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
and made a walkin' talkin' honeycomb
well honeycomb won't you be my baby
well honeycomb be my own
what a darn good life
when you got a wife like honeycomb
honeycomb
and the lord says now that i made a bird
i'm gonna look all round for a little ol' word
that sounds about sweet like turtledove
and i guess i'm gonna call it love
and he roamed the world lookin' everywhere
gettin' love from here love from there
and he put it all in a little ol' part
of my baby's heart
oh honeycomb won't you be my baby
well honeycomb be my own
got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone
and made a walkin' talkin' honeycomb
well honeycomb won't you be my baby
well honeycomb be my own
what a darn good life
when you got a wife like honeycomb
honeycomb 
see the tree how big it's grown
but friend it hasn't been too long
it wasn't big
i laughed at her and she got mad
the first day that she planted it
was just a twig
then the first snow came
and she ran out to brush the snow away
so it wouldn't die
came runnin' in all excited
slipped and almost hurt herself
and i laughed 'til i cried
she was always young at heart
kinda dumb and kinda smart
and i loved her so
and i surprised her with a puppy
kept me up all christmas eve
2 years ago
and it would sure embarrass her when i came in from workin' late
cause i would know
that she'd been sittin there an' cryin'
over some sad and silly late late show
and honey i miss you
and i'm bein' good
and i'd love to be with you
if only i could
she wrecked the car and she was sad
and so afraid that i'd be mad
but what the heck
though i pretended hard to be
guess you could say she saw through me
and hugged my neck
i came home unexpectedly
and caught her cryin' needlessly in the middle of the day
and it was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robins sing
she went away
and honey i miss you
and i'm bein' good
and i'd love to be with you
if only i could
one day while i was not at home 
while she was there and all alone
the angels came
now all i have is memories of honey
and i wake up nights
and call her name
now my life's an empty stage where honey lived and honey played
and love grew up
and a small cloud passes over head
and cries down on the flower bed that
honey loved
and see the tree how big it's grown
but friend it hasn't been too long
it wasn't big
and i laughed at her she got mad
the first day that she planted it
was just a twig 
turn it up some
alright boys this is her favorite song
you know that right
so if we play it good and loud
she might get up and dance again
ooh she put her beer down
here she comes
here she comes
left left left right left
whoo
husslers shootin' eightball
throwin' darts at the wall
feelin' damn near 10 ft tall
here she comes lord help us all
ol' tw's girlfriend done slapped him outta his chair

dirt road in the twilight
woods so cool and dark
up ahead pale neon
some where a dog barks
honky tonk moon
keeps shining on my baby and me
breaking up the pool balls
chalking up the cues
jukebox pumping softly
lazy summer blues 
honky tonk moon
keep shining on my baby and me
 
through the blue smoky haze
all through the day
troubles seem to melt away
my heart's on a roll
i'm easy in my soul
there's no hurry no worry
things are going my way
my arms around my baby
shuffling on the floor
cigarettes and sawdust
squeaky old screen door
honky tonk moon 
keep shining on my baby and me

outside the dark has fallen
stars are winking bright
an old hoot owl is calling 
everything's all right
honky tonk moon
keep shining on my baby and me

 one two three four 
ah hot dog
well i well i well i just got into town today
to find my girl who's gone away
she took the greyhound at the general store
i searched myself i searched the town
when i finally did sit down
i find myself no wiser than before
she said we couldn't do no wrong
no other love could be so strong
she locked up my heart in her bottom drawer
now she took my heart she took my keys
from in my old blue dungarees
and i'll never go to texas anymore
now my baby's gone i don't know what to do
she took my love and walked right out the door
and if i ever find that girl i know one thing for sure
i'm gonna give her something like she never had before
i took her love at seventeen
a little late these days it seems
but they said heaven is well worth waiting for
i took her word i took it all
beneath the sign that said uhaul
she left angels hangin' 'round for more
ah more
yeah now my baby's gone i don't know what to do
she took my love and walked right out the door
and if i ever find that girl i know one thing for sure
i'm gonna give her something like she never had before
i thought i had it all sewn up
our love a plot a pickup truck
but folks said she was after something more
i never did quite understand
all that talk about rockin' bands
but they just rolled my doll right out the door
ooh yeah they just rolled my doll right out the door
why well they just rolled my doll right out the door 


i felt the rush of the rio grande into yellowstone
and i've seen firsthand niagra falls
and the lights of vegas
i've crisscrossed down to key biscayane
and chitown via bangor maine
think i've seen it all
and all i can say is

how 'bout them cowgirls
boys ain't they somthin'
sure are some proud girls
and you can't tell them nothin'
and i tell you right now girls
may just be seven wonders of this big old round world
but how 'bout them cowgirls
she's a ridin' colts in steamboat springs
bailing hay outside abilene
she's trying hard
to fit in some city
but her home is 'neath that big blue sky
and the northern plains and those other wide open spaces

boy she don't need you and she don't need me
she can do just fine on her own two feet
but she wants a man who wants her to be herself
and she'll never change don't know how to hide
her stubborn will or her fightin' side
but you treat her right and she'll love you like no on else
yeah how 'bout them cowgirls
boys ain't they somethin'
sure some are proud girls
but you can't beat their lovin'
and i'll tell you right now girls
may just be seven wonders of this big old round world
but how 'bout them cowgirls
how 'bout them boys

chely wright
cautions in the wind
the hardest part is through
you don't have to try so hard 
to make me fall for you
i've surprised myself 
with what i've gone and done
just today i heard myself 
swear you were the one

laugh i just have to laugh
i really thought you knew
i can't believe 
that you're asking me 
when i will love you
i already do
i already do
you've been doing fine
please don't change a thing
it's too good to hide away 
so i might as well come clean
i didn't shout it out 
but everybody knew
funny you're the only one who didn't have a clue

i gave you my heart 
can't you feel the power
you want to see the light
baby the sun's been up for hours
 





i don't believe in superstars organic food and foreign cars
i don't believe the price of gold the certainty of growing old
that right is right and left is wrong that north and south can't get along
that east is east and west is west and being first is always best
but i believe in love i believe in babies i believe in mom and dad and i believe in you
i don't believe that heaven waits for only those who congregate
i like to think of god as love he's down below he's up above
he's watchin' people everywhere he knows who does and doesn't care
and i'm an ordinary man sometimes i wonder who i am
but i believe in love i believe in music i believe in magic and i believe in you
well i know with all my certainty what's going on with you and me is a good thing
it's true i believe in you
well i don't believe virginity is as common as it used to be
in working days and sleeping nights that black is black and white is white
that superman and robin hood are still alive in hollywood
that gasoline's in short supply the rising cost of gettin' by
but i believe in love i believe in old folks i believe in children and i believe in you
 guitar  

they read you cinderella
you hoped it would come true
that one day your prince charming
would come rescue you

the way you felt when romeo kissed juliet

well baby open up your eyes

you want tenderness tenderness

and i see through to the heart of you
if you want a man want a man who understands
well you don't have to look very far

our love is unconditional we knew it from the start

from here on after let's stay the way we are right now 
and share all the love and laughter that a lifetime will allow 
 
i cross my heart and promise to 
give all i've got to give to make all your dreams come true 
in all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine 
you will always be the miracle that makes my life complete 
and as long as there's a breath in me 
i'll make yours just as sweet

in all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine 
a love as true as mine 
i've been living with a heart on the mend 
wondering how will i ever be strong 
i know i'll live to love again 
i just leaned on you too long 
it's been an uphill fight 
but i'm going to be alright 
 
i didn't know my own strength 
till i had to pick myself up 
and carry on without your love 
i'm getting back on my feet 
its been a long hard fall 
but i'll make it after all 
no i didn't know my own strength 
i've had oceans of tears to get through 
and the weight of the world on my mind 
there's been mountains of memories to lose 
and i've been beating back the blows to my pride 
but till the times got tough 
i never knew what i was made of 
 
i didn't know my own strength 
till i had to pick myself up 
and carry on without your love 
i'm getting back on my feet 
its been a long hard fall 
but i'll make it after 
no i didn't know my own strength 
then the times got tough 
and i knew what i was made of 
i didn't know my own strength 
till i had to pick myself up 
and carry on without your love 
i'm getting back on my feet 
its been a long hard fall 
but i'll make it after 
no i didn't know my own strength 
all i am all i'll be
everything in this world all that i'll ever need
is in your eyes shining at me
when you smile i can feelall my passion unfolding
your hand brushes mine
and a thousand sensations seduce me 'cause i
i do cherish you
for the rest of my life
you don't have to think twice
i will love you still
from the depths of my soul it's beyond my control
i've waited so long to say this to you
if you're asking do i love you this much
i do
in my world before you
i lived outside my emotions didn't know where i was going
'til that day i found you
how you opened my life to a new paradise
in a world torn by change
still with all of my heart until my dying day

if you're asking do i love you this much
i do oh i do 
i keep rollin' it over and over
all the things i want to say
i'll never quit give up or forget you
my love will stand in the way 

cause i don't believe in goodbye
and i believe it takes time
to build something strong it won't take long
for you to believe in me just look in my eyes
i don't believe in goodbye 
where love goes we must follow
and let our hearts lead the way
we'll be the last of the true believers
first in love and last to stay 
 
i don't believe in goodbye
and i believe it takes time
to build something strong
it won't take long for you to believe in me
just look in my eyes
i don't believe in goodbye
i don't believe in goodbye
i don't believe in goodbye
i don't believe in goodbye 
well i was sitting in a roadhouse down on highway 41
you were wipin' off some ketchup on a table that was done

i'm in love with you baby and i don't even know your name
so i ordered straight tequila a little courage in a shot
and i asked you for a date and then i asked to tie knot
i got a little wasted ya i went a little far
i finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
the last thing i remember i heard myself say i'm in love with you baby
and i don't even know your name

the next thing i remembered i was hearing weddin' bells
standing by a woman in a long white lacy veil
i raised the veil she smiled at me without her left front tooth
and i said where the hell am i and just who the hell are you
she said i was your waitress and our last name's now the same
cause i'm married to you baby and i don't even know your name
yah i'm married to a waitress i don't even know her name
i've never been too good with all those sexual games
i never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
hey i'm married to a waitress and i don't even know her name

i don't need you
i don't need friendship
i don't need flowers in the spring
i don't need you
and you surely don't need me
i don't need love and affection
i don't peace and harmony
i don't need you
and you surely don't need me
but we both want it bad enough
yes we both want it don't we
i don't need you baby
and i know you don't need me
i don't need your loving arms around me
all i need is to be free
that's what i keep telling myself
and i tell you you don't need me
i don't need children in my old age
no more cluttered leaves around the tree
and i don't need you baby
and i know you don't need me
but we both want it bad enough
yes we both want it don't we
i don't need you baby
and i know you don't need me
and we don't need each other baby
we don't need each other baby
or do we 

i've seen the storm clouds in your past
but rest assured 'cause you are safe at home at last
i rescued you you rescued me
and we're right where we should be when we're together
i know the questions in your mind
but go ahead and ask me one more time
you'll find the answer's still the same
it won't change from day to day for worse or better

will i promise to be your best friend
and am i here until the end
can i be sure i have been waiting for you
and did i say my love is true
baby i will i am i can i have i do
i know the time will disappear
but this love we're building on will always be here
no way that this is sinking sand
on this solid rock we'll stand forever

baby i will i am i can i have
oh i will i am i can i have
baby i will i am i can i have i do

i fall to pieces
each time i see you again
i fall to pieces
how can i be just your friend
you want me to act like we've never kissed
you want me to forget pretend we've never met
and i've tried and i've tried but i haven't yet
you walk by and i fall to pieces
i fall to pieces
each time someone speaks your name
i fall to pieces
time only adds to the flame
you tell me to find someone else to love
someone who'll love me too the way you used to do
but each time i go out with someone new
you walk by and i fall to pieces
i fall to pieces
each time someone speaks your name
i fall to pieces
time only adds to the flame
you tell me to find someone else to love
someone who'll love me too the way you used to do
but each time i go out with someone new
you walk by and i fall to pieces

may you never take one single breath for granted
god forbid love ever leave you empty handed
i hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
whenever one door closes i hope one more opens
promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
i hope you dancei hope you dance
i hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
never settle for the path of least resistance
livin' might mean takin' chances but they're worth takin'
lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin'
don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter
when you come close to sellin' out reconsider
give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
i hope you dancei hope you dance

time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along
tell me who wants to look back on their years
and wonder where those years have gone

and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

i hope you dancei hope you dance
time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along
tell me who wants to look back on their years
and wonder where those years have gone

oh you hide it so well

only a fool would believe what you say
so don't you knock on my door i won't be home anymore you can find me out walking in the sun
oh you hide it so well

it's been a long time
since we walked that aisle together
and you became my wife
and who would've thought
you would fall for someone just like me
for the best days of my life
i may not be a poet
cause i ain't so good on words
i may not stand before you
like a knight in shining armor
i may not be the best of singers
there's better guys i've heard
but i know how to love
i know how to love you well
you got your faults
and i don't need to tell you i've got mine
well i guess they all even out
wherever i ride
the thought of you turns water into wine
and somehow i lose a crowd
i may not drive a fancy car
i don't know what it's for
i may not be the one
who gets to shower you in diamonds
i may not be a rich man
but you can't call me poor
cause i know how to love
i know how to love you well
as we skip the light fandango
from that old jukebox by the bar
now honey don't it make you wonder
how we ever got this far
i may not be a poet
cause i ain't got much to say
i may not stand before you
like that knight in shining armor
i may not be the best of singers
honey that's ok
cause i know how to love
i know how to love
i know how to love
you well 

well i love a rainy night
i love a rainy night
i love to hear the thunder
watch the lightning
when it lights up the sky
you know it makes me feel good
well i love a rainy night
it's such a beautiful sight
i love to feel the rain
on my face
to taste the rain on my lips
in the moonlight shadow

showers washed
all my cares away
i'd wake up to a sunny day
'cause i love a rainy night
yes i love a rainy night
well i love a rainy night
i love a rainy night
well i love a rainy night
i love a rainy night
i love to hear the thunder
watch the lightning
when it lights up the sky
you know it makes me feel good
well i love a rainy night
it's such a beautiful sight
i love to feel the rain
on my face
to taste the rain on my lips
in the moonlight shadow
puts a song
in this heart of mine
puts a smile on my face every time
'cause i love a rainy night
yeah i love a rainy night
ooh i love a rainy night
yeah i love a rainy night
 
i like the feel of your name on my lips
and i like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
the way that your fingers run through my hair
and how your scent lingers even when you're not there
and i like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
and how you enjoy your two hour bath
and how you convinced me to dance in the rain
with everyone watching like we were insane

but i love the way you love me
strong and wild slow and easy
heart and soul so completely
i love the way you love me
i like to imitate ol' jerry lee
an' watch you roll your eyes when i'm slightly offkey
and i like the innocent way that you cry
at sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times

and i could list a million things i love to like about you
but they all come down to one reason i could never live without you
 

look at the two of you dancing that way
lost in the moment and each others face
so much in love your alone in this place
like there's nobody else in the world
i was enough for her not long ago
i was her number one
she told me so
and she still means the world to me
just so you know
so be careful when you hold my girl
time changes everything
life must go on
and i'm not gonna stand in your way
but i loved her first and i held her first
and a place in my heart will always be hers
from the first breath she breathed
when she first smiled at me
i knew the love of a father runs deep
and i prayed that she'd find you someday
but it still hard to give her away
i loved her first
how could that beautiful women with you
be the same freckle face kid that i knew
the one that i read all those fairy tales to
and tucked into bed all those nights
and i knew the first time i saw you with her
it was only a matter of time
but i loved her first and i held her first
and a place in my heart will always be hers
from the first breath she breathed
when she first smiled at me
i knew the love of a father runs deep
and i prayed that she'd find you someday
but its still hard to give her away
i loved her first
from the first breath she breathed
when she first smiled at me
i knew the love of a father runs deep
someday you might know what i'm going through
when a miracle smiles up at you
i loved her first 
when you light those candles
up there on that mantle setting the mood
well i just lie there staring
silently preparing to love on you
well i can feel the heat from across the room
aint it wild what a little flame
can make you wanna do

i melt everytime you look at me that way
it never fails anytime any place
this burn in me is the coolest thing i've ever felt
i melt
don't know how you do it
i love the way i lose it everytime
whats even better 
is knowing that forever you're all mine
the closer you get the more my body aches
one little stare from you is all it takes
 twice
evertime you look at me that way
i melt i melt 
tim

i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
when you take you gotta give so live and let live and let go oh oh oh oh
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
i could promise you things like big diamond rings
but you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
so you better think it over
well if sweet talking you could make it come true
i would give you the world right now on a silver platter
but what would it matter
so smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
come along and share the good times while we can
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
i could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
but if that's what it takes to hold you i'd just as soon let you go
but there's one thing i want you to know
you'd better look before you leap still waters run deep
and there won't always be someone there to pull you out
and you know what i'm talking about
so smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
come along and share the good times while we can
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime 


i run from hate
i run from prejudice
i run from pessimists
but i run too late
i run my life
or is it running me
run from my past
i run too fast
or too slow it seems
when lies become the truth
thatís when i run to you

this world keeps spinning faster
into a new disaster so i run to you
i run to you baby
and when it all starts coming undone
baby youíre the only one i run to
i run to you
we run on fumes
your life and mine
like the sands of time
slippiní right on through
and our loveís the only truth
thatís why i run to you
 x 2 
i just walked down the street to the coffee shop
had to take a break
i'd been by her side for eighteen hours straight
i saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
pushing up through the concrete
like it was planted right there for me to see
the flashin' lights the honkin' horns
all seemed to fade away
in the shadow of that hospital at 508
i saw god today

i've been to church
i've read the book
i know he's here but i don't look
near as often as i should
yeah i know i should
his fingerprints are everywhere
i'd just slow down to stop and stare
opened my eyes and man i swear
i saw god today
i saw a couple walking by they were holding hands
man she had that glow
yeah i couldn't help but notice she was starting to show
it stood there for a minute takin' the sky
lost in that sunset
a splash of amber melted in the shades of red

i got my face pressed up against the nursery glass
she's sleeping like a rock
my name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks
she's got my nose she's got her mama's eyes
my brand new baby girl
she's a miracle
i saw god today 
everybody wants a little piece of my time
but still i put you at the end of the line
how it breaks my heart to cause you this pain
to see the tears you cry fallin' like rain
give me the chance to prove
and i'll make it up to you
i still believe in you
with a love that will always be
standing so strong and true
baby i still believe in you and me
somewhere along the way i guess i just lost track
only thinkin' of myself never lookin' back
for all the times i've hurt you i apologize
i'm sorry it took so long to finally realize
give me the chance to prove
that nothing's worth losing you
i still believe in you
with a love that will always be
standing so strong and true
baby i still believe in you and me 
verse 1

and though i'll make mistakes
i'll never break your heart

we'll hang some memories on the wall
and when there's silver in your hair
you won't have to ask if i still care
'cause as time turns the page
my love won't age at all
i swear
by the moon and stars in the sky
i'll be there

like the shadow that's by your side
i'll be there
for better or worse
till death do us part
i'll love you with every beat of my heart

marychapin carpenterdon schlitz
i took a walk in the rain one day on the wrong side of the tracks
i stood on the rails till i saw that train
just to see how my heart would react
now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate
and for them i would not disagree
but i never learned nothing from playing it safe
i say fate should not tempt me
i take my chances i don't mind working without a net
i take my chances i take my chances every chance i get
i sat alone in the dark one night tuning in by remote
i found a preacher who spoke of the light but there was brimstone in his throat
he'd show me the way according to him in return for my personal check
i flipped my channel back to cnn and i lit another cigarette
 live version i flipped my channel back to cnn and i threw away my cigarettes 
i take my chances forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
i take my chances i take my chances every chance i get
i've crossed lines of words and wire and both have cut me deep
i've been frozen out and i've been on fire and the tears are mine to weep
now i can cry until i laugh and laugh until i cry
so cut the deck right in half i'll play from either side
i take my chances i pay my dollar and i place my bet
i take my chances i take my chances every chance i get
i take my chances i don't cling to remorse or regret
i take my chances i take my chances every chance i get
i take my chances
i take my chances 
suppose i called you up tonight and told you that i love you
and suppose i said i wanna come back home
and suppose i cried and said i think i finally learned my lesson
and i'm tired of spending all my time alone
if i told you that i realized you're all i ever wanted
and it's killing me to be so far away
would you tell me that you love me too and would we cry together
or would you simply laugh at me and say
i told you so oh i told you so
i told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
i told you so but you had to go
now i found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
if i got down on my knees and told you i was yours forever
would you get down on yours to and take my hand
would we get that old time feeling would we laugh and talk for hours
the way we did when our love first began
would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely
and you've waited for the day that i returned
and we'd live in love forever and that i'm your one and only
or would you say the tables finally turned
would you say
i told you so oh i told you so
i told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
i told you so but you had to go
now i found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
now i found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again 
you said you needed your space
i wasn't where you wanted to be
i didn't stand in your way
i only want you to be happy
and so how surprised am i to see you here tonight

oh can't you see
that for worse or for better we're better together
please just come back home
no don't say that you're sorry
and i won't say i told you so
sometimes in our life
we get to where we wonder if
the long road that we're on
is headin' in the same direction
well when it comes to you and me
we're right where i know we should be

oh can't you see
that for worse or for better we're better together
please just come back home
no don't say that you're sorry
and i won't say i told you so
somtimes it's like we're deep in nothing but love
the slightest thing can grow so foolishly
remind me please
oh can't you see
that for worse or for better we're better together
please just come back home
no don't say that you're sorry
you don't gotta say you're sorry baby
oh can't you see
that for worse or for better we're better together
please just come back home
no don't say that you're sorry
and i won't say i told you so
and i won't say i told you so
but i told you so
shoulda known better than to leave me baby
shoulda known better than to leave me darlin' 
suppose i called you up tonight
and told you that i love you
and suppose i said i want to come back home
and suppose i cried and said i think
i finally learned my lesson
and i'm tired of spending all my time alone
if i told you that i realize 
you're all i ever wanted
and it's killing me to be so far away
would you tell me that you love me too
and would we cry together
or would you simply laugh at me and say
i told you so
oh i told you so
i told you some day you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
i told you so
but you had to go 
and now i've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
if got down on my knees
and told you i was yours forever
would you get down on yours too and take my hand
would we get that oldtime feeling
would we laugh and talk for hours
the way we did when our love first began
would you tell me that you've missed me too
and that you've been so lonely
and you've waited for the day that i return
and we'd live and love forever
and that i'm your one and only
or would you say the table's finally turned
would you say i told you so
oh i told you so
i told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
i told you so
but you had to go 
and now i've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

and you will never break my heart in two again 
gary burr
oh i'm sorry i forgot where i was
i try to think about elvis
memphis
oprah in the afternoon
i try to think about palm trees
fig leaves
the creature from the black lagoon
i try to think about high heels
and good deals
anything to get me through
i just can't concentrate
you're all i think about these days
i try to contemplate the cosmos
what goes
round and round the sky at night
i try to think about champagne
freight trains
slowly rolling out of sight
i try to focus on the headlines
street crimes
everytime i think i might
i just can't concentrate
you're all i think about these days
my mind wanders where it will
when it settles right on you
i forget what i should say
i forget what i should do
my mind wanders where it will
when it settles right on you
i forget what i should say
i forget what i should do
come on patty get it together
i try to think about shakespeare
leap year
the beatles or the rolling stones
i try to think about hairdo's
tattoos
sushi bars and saxophones
i try to think about the talk shows
new clothes
but i guess i should have known
i just can't concentrate
you're all i think about these days
you're all i think about these days 
i keep a close watch on this heart of mine
i keep my eyes wide open all the time
i keep the ends out for the tie that binds
because you're mine i walk the line
i find it very very easy to be true
i find myself alone when each day is through
yes i'll admit that i'm a fool for you
because you're mine i walk the line
as sure as night is dark and day is light
i keep you on my mind both day and night
and happiness i've known proves that it's right
because you're mine i walk the line
you've got a way to keep me on your side
you give me cause for love that i can't hide
for you i know i'd even try to turn the tide
because you're mine i walk the line
i keep a close watch on this heart of mine
i keep my eyes wide open all the time

when she got the news
the phone hit the floor
she fell to her knees
and cried his name
he had just kissed her lips
and both of the kids
their lives will never be the same
the end of her hardest day
the only words she could say were
i want you to live
i want you to love
i want to go back to the way it was
to hear you say my name again
i want to see you smile again
i want you to live
it takes all of her strength
to go through his things
it feels like she's holding him again
the letters he wrote books that he'd read
and some of his shirts still had his scent
the picture in florida
she holds to her heart and cries out loud
i want you to live
i want you to love
i want to go back to the way it was
to hear you say my name again
i want to see your smile again
lying awake in the middle of the night
trying not to let the kids hear her cry
she prays for an answer some little of sign
and closes her eyes
and swears she hears him say
i want you to live
i want you to love
i want you to go on and not give up
i want you to live
i want you to try
i want you to know that i'm alright
i want you to fall in love again
i want to see you smile again
and again
i want you to live 
if i should stay 
i would only be in your way 
so i'll go and yet i know 
i'll think of you each step of the way 
and i will always love you 
i will always love you 
bittersweet memories 
that's all i have and i'm taking with me 
goodbye please don't you cry 
cause we both know i'm not what you need 
but i will always love you 
i will always love you 
i hope life i hope life 
treats you kind treats you kind 
and i hope you have all you dream of 
i wish you joy i wish you joy 
and happiness and happiness 
but above all this i wish you love oh 
and i will always love you 
i will always love you 
yes i will always love you 
i will always love you 
if i should stay 
i would only be in your way 
so i'll go and yet i know 
i'll think of you each step of the way 
and i will always love you 
i will always love you 
bittersweet memories 
that's all i have and i'm taking with me 
goodbye please don't you cry 
cause we both know i'm not what you need 
but i will always love you 
i will always love you

and i hope you have all you dream of

te amo 



i wouldn't change a single thing about you if i could
the way you are just suits me too a tee
a princess in a storybook
a king upon his throne
that's what we are and you belong too me

i wouldn't change you if i could
i love you as you are
you're all that i would wish for
if i wished upon a star
an angel sent from heaven
you're everything that's good
you're perfect just the way you are
i wouldn't change you if i could
your eyes your lips your tender smile
i'd leave them as they are
and come what may i'd never change a thing
and if i were a potter
and you a piece of clay
the only thing i'd change would be your name

i wouldn't change you if i could
i love you as you are
you're all that i would wish for
if i wished upon a star
an angel sent from heaven
you're everything that's good
you're perfect just the way you are
i wouldn't change you if i could 
has it been ten years
since we said i do
i've always heard marriage 
made one seem like two
but you're looking better 
than you did back then
you still make this old heart give in

and if i had it to do all over
i'd do it all over again
if tomorrow i found one more chance to begin
i'd love you all over again
the preacher man said 
til death do us part
that seemed like forever 
to a young man's heart
now the days seem much shorter
the longer we love
and the memories just keep adding up

and if i had it to do all over
i'd still do it all over again
if tomorrow i found one more chance to begin
i'd love you all over again
if tomorrow i found 
one more chance to begin
i'd love you all over again 

i'll go back to her where i'm wanted
and maybe i can make up for the wrong
in spite of all i've done she still wants me
so i'll go back to her where i belong
walking out on her wasn't easy
but without a second thought i left her there
i gave my all i did it all to please you
but the more i seemed to do the less you cared

so i'll go back to her where i'm wanted
and maybe i can make up for the wrong
in spite of all i've done she still wants me
i'll go back to her where i belong
  
you were playing games from the beginning
and any fool could plainly see that you have won
she's waiting there and there's nothing here to keep me
if you can then i can't live with what we've done

i'll go back to her where i'm wanted
maybe i can make up for the wrong
in spite of all i've done she still wants me
so i'll go back to her where i belong
yeah i'll go back to her where i belong 
when i look into your soft green eyes
when i see your delicate body
revealed to me as you slip off your dress
i'm reminded what i feel for you
will remain strong and true
long after the pleasures of the flesh
then i'll go on loving you 
i'll go on loving you
i'll go on loving you
be it the wind or the rain
or the moon up in the sky
the spin of the earth or the changes in the tide
i don't know what brought us together
what strange forces of nature
conspire to construct the present
from the past
then i'll go on loving you 
i'll go on loving you
i'll go on loving you
when i look into your soft green eyes
when i see your delicate body
revealed to me as you slip off your dress
i'm reminded what i feel for you
will remain strong and true
long after the pleasures of the flesh
then i'll go on loving you 
i'll go on loving you
i'll go on loving you 
walk away leave with my blessing
once in a while let me hear from you
if we never meet again before my life is over
i'll leave this world loving you
you can take everything but my memories
for they're good ones and they'll see me through
if we never meet again i'll love you forever
i'll leave this world loving you
you were mine for a time and i'm thankful
oh but life will be so lonesome without you
if we never meet again this side of heaven
i'll leave this world loving you
if we never meet again this side of heaven
i'll leave this world loving you

he called her on the road
from a lonely cold hotel room

of the kids laughing in the background

and keep movin' me on

a young mans dreams
wild as a mountain stream
rush all to the sea
well i was restless and i was reckless
trying to stay free
i swore that no one would hold me very long 
but in your arms i found the place where i belonged
now i'm not running anymore
no more chasing down the sun
the moment i looked in your eyes i knew you were the one
oh your velvet chains have taken my heart for sure
and baby it's a sweet surrender
i'm not running anymore
the clouds rolled by 
in the blue summer sky
and i watched them disappear 
cause i'm satisfied and finally life is right 
well you make it all so clear
if you hadn't saved me i would still be on my own 
and not knowing where i'm going just rambling on and on
but i'm not running anymore
no more chasing down the sun
the moment i looked in your eyes i knew you were the one
oh your velvet chains have taken my heart for sure
and baby it's a sweet surrender
i'm not running anymore
till you helped me i was never any free
wrapped here in your love is right where i want to be
no i'm not running anymore
no more chasing down the sun
the moment i looked in your eyes i knew you were the one
oh your velvet chains have taken my heart for sure
and baby it's a sweet surrender
i'm not running anymore 
seven weeks have passed now since she left me
she shows her face to ask me how i am
she says the kids are fine and that they miss me
maybe i could come and babysit sometime
she says are you okay i was worried about you
can you forgive me i hope that you'll be happy
i said i'm so happy that i can't stop crying
i'm so happy i'm laughing through my tears
i saw a friend of mine he said i was worried about you
i heard she had another man i wondered how you felt about it
i'm so happy that i can't stop crying
i'm so happy i'm laughing through my tears
saw my lawyer mr good news
he got me joint custody and legal separation
so i'm so happy that i can't stop crying
i'm laughing through my tears
i'm laughing through my tears
i took a walk alone last night
i looked up at the stars to try to find an answer in my life
i chose a star for me
i chose a star for him
i chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife
something made me smile
something seemed to ease the pain
something about the universe and how it's all connected
the park is full of sunday fathers and melted ice cream
we try to do the best within the given time
a kid should be with his mother everybody knows that
what can a father do but babysit sometime
i saw that friend of mine he said you look different somehow
i said everybody's got to leave the darkness sometime
i said i'm so happy that i can't stop crying
i'm laughing through my tears
i'm laughing through my tears
i'm so happy that i can't stop crying
i'm laughing through my tears 
it's cold here in the city
it always seems that way
and i've been thinking about you almost everyday
thinking about the good times
thinking about the rain
thinking about how bad it feels alone again
i'm sorry for the way things are in china
i'm sorry things ain't what they used to be
but more than anything else
i'm sorry for myself
'cause you're not here with me
our friends all ask about you
i say you're doing fine
and i expect to hear from you almost anytime
but they all know i'm crying
and i can't sleep at night
they all know i'm dying down deep inside
i'm sorry for all the lies i told you
i'm sorry for the things i didn't say
but more than anything else
i'm sorry for myself
i can't believe you went away
break
i'm sorry if i took some things for granted
i'm sorry for the chains i put on you
but more than anything else
i'm sorry for myself
for living without you
it's cold here in the city
it always seems that way
and i've been thinking about you almost everyday 
when you see a deer you see bambi
and i see antlers up on the wall
when you see a lake you think picnics
and i see a largemouth up under that log
you're probably thinking you're gonna change me
in some ways well maybe you might
scrub me down dress me up
ah but no matter what
remember i'm still a guy
when you see a priceless french painting
i see a drunk naked girl
you think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
and i'd like to give it a whirl
well love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
and in a weak moment i might 
walk your sissy dog hold your purse at the mall
but remember i'm still a guy
and i'll pour out my heart
hold your hand in the car
write a love song that makes you cry
then turn right around
knock some jerk to the ground
'cause he copped a feel as you walked by
i can hear you now talking to your friends
saying yeah girls he's come a long way
from dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
and building a fire in a cave
but when you say a backrub means only a backrub
then you swat my hand when i try
well now what can i say at the end of the day
honey i'm still a guy
and i'll pour out my heart
hold your hand in the car
write a love song that makes you cry
then turn right around
knock some jerk to the ground
'cause he copped a feel as you walked by
these days there's dudes getting facials
manicured waxed and botoxed
with deep spray on tans and creamy lotioney hands
you can't grip a tackle box
yeah with all of these men lining up to get neutered
it's hip now to be feminized
but i don't highlight my hair
i've still got a pair
yeah honey i'm still a guy
my eyebrows ain't plucked
there's a gun in my truck
oh thank god i'm still a guy 
chick rainswade hayes
i'm sittin' here surrounded by people i know
the beer's cold and the music's good and loud
that used to be enough to put a smile on my face
but tonight i just feel lost in this crowd
there's a brunette on the dance floor
that smiled a time or two
so i got up and asked her for a dance
but when she put her arms around me
and i held her i knew
it was just too soon to take another chance
'cause i'm still dancin' with you
i know we said we were through
but i keep holdin' on
letting go is just too hard to do
even when i'm holding someone new
i'm still dancin' with you
when the song was over i held on a little longer
deep inside i knew that it was wrong
i could hold her in my arms for the rest of the night
but i'd just be leading her on
'cause i'm still dancin' with you
i know we said we were through
but i keep holdin' on
letting go is just too hard to do
even when i'm holding someone new
i'm still dancin' with you
even when i'm holding someone new
i'm still dancin' with you

if i could make a livin' out of lovin' you
i'd be a millionaire in a week or two
i'd be doin' what i love
and lovin' what i do
if i could make a livin' out of lovin' you
early in the morning when the sun comes up
i'm punchin' that clock on the wall
breakin' my back just to make you bucks
wishin' i was in your arms

i could work all day and feel right at home
lovin' that 8 to 5
never have to leave you here alone 
when i'm workin' that overtime
3x 
well i lost my heart on the day we met
but i gained a lot that i don't regret
then i hung around til you said 'i do'
knew i wouldn't have nothin if i didn't have you
well it changed my thinking when you changed your name
neither one of us will ever be the same
and i swear i'm never gonna be untrue
cuz i wouldn't have nothing if i didn't have you
if i didn't have you i'd long ago been left in the dark out in the cold
blowing around from town to town like a feather in the wind
if i didn't have you i know i'd be
floundering around like a ship at sea
lost in the rain or a hurricane that's where i'd have been
but i didn't get lost cuz i saw your light
shining like a beacon on a cold dark night
and the sun came up and the skies turned blue
oh i wouldn't have nothing if i didn't have you
well i count my blessings
every night i pray
that the lord lets me keep you just one more day
every day he does cuz god knows too
that i wouldn't have nothing if i didn't have you
if i didn't have you i'd long ago been left in the dark out in the cold
blowing around from town to town like a feather in the wind
if i didn't have you i know i'd be
floundering around like a ship at sea
lost in the rain or a hurricane that's where i'd have been
but i didn't get lost cuz i saw your light
shining like a beacon on a cold dark night
and the sun came up and the skies turned blue
oh i wouldn't have nothing if i didn't have you
well i've already said it but i swear it's true
i wouldn't have nothing if i didn't have you 





buddy you and me go way back
camp lejeune all through highschool
and before that
so i dont mind telling you i'm scared to death
the doctor's going in on the 25th
its the same thing my daddy had
thank god they caught it fast
but if something should happen
stop in sometime and say hello to katherine
you and mary anne could always keep her laughing
she's going to need alot of that
take her out to a movie
its going to take some time before she's back on her feet
i know you think that i'll be fine and i'm talking crazy 
but there's always that chance
that's why i'm asking
if something should happen
little nathan's growing up so fast
this november he'll turn 10
he wants to play quarterback
im supposed to coach his team this fall
but i may not get to after all
he's going to need someone to catch a pass
and to throw it back
if something should happen
oh promise me you'll take that boy out camping
throw a line out in that water every now and then
answer any question that he has
maybe once he gets older 
you can sit and have that first cold beer together
and tell him a couple stories on his father
he's always known you were my best friend
that's why im asking
if something should happen
i hope i live until i'm 80
and i get to see my son get married
and have babies 
and make a million more memories with my wife
yeah buddy i pray alright
but if its my time to leave
would you watch over them for me
if something should happen
if something should happen
mm hmm hmm 
diablo motors had a hell of a sale downtown yesterday
word got around no money down take years and years to pay
when i got there the lot was bare but the salesman said hold on
for a little cash i gotta twotone nash out behind the barn
if the devil danced in empty pockets he'd have a ball in mine
with a nine foot grand a ten piece band and a twelve girl  line
i'd raise some loot in a three piece suit give 'em one dance for a dime
if the devil danced in empty pockets he'd have a ball in mine
well he said friend it ain't the end let's see what i can do
if you own a home i've got a loan tailor made for you
then above the racket a voice in my jacket said i'll tote the note
the devil made me do it talked me in to it and that was all she wrote
if the devil danced in empty pockets he'd have a ball in mine
with a nine foot grand a ten piece band and a twelve girl  line
i'd raise some loot in a three piece suit give 'em one dance for a dime
if the devil danced in empty pockets he'd have a ball in mine
they say debt is a bottomless pit where the devil likes to play
i'd sell my soul to get out of this hole but there'd be hell to pay
if the devil danced in empty pockets he'd have a ball in mine
with a nine foot grand a ten piece band and a twelve girl  line
i'd raise some loot in a three piece suit give 'em one dance for a dime
if the devil danced in empty pockets he'd have a ball in mine 
it was where my mama sat on that old swing with her crochet
it was where granddaddy taught me how to cuss and how to pray
it was where we made our own ice cream those sultry summer nights
where the bulldog had her puppiesand us brothers had our fights
there were many nights i'd sit right there and look out at the stars
to the sound of a distant whippoorwill or the hum of a passing car
it was where i first got up the nerve to steal me my first kiss
and it was where i learned to play guitar and pray i had the gift
if the world had a front porch like we did back then
we'd still have our problems but we'd all be friends
treating your neighbor like he's your next of kin
wouldn't be gone like the wind
if the world had a front porch like we did back then
purple hulls and pintos i've shelled more than my share
as lightening bugs and crickets danced in the evening air
and like a beacon that old yellow bulb it always led me home
somehow mama always knew just when to leave it on
if the world had a front porch like we did back then
we'd still have our problems but we'd all be friends
treating your neighbor like he's your next of kin
wouldn't be gone like the wind
if the world had a front porch like we did back then 
sometimes late at night
i lie awake and watch her sleeping
she's lost in peaceful dreams
so i turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
and the thought crosses my mind
if i never wake up in the morning
would she ever doubt the way i feel
about her in my heart
if tomorrow never comes
will she know how much i loved her
did i try in every way to show her every day
that she's my only one
and if my time on earth were through
and she must face the world without me
is the love i gave her in the past
gonna be enough to last
if tomorrow never comes
'cause i've lost loved ones in my life
who never knew how much i loved them
now i live with the regret
that my true feelings for them never were revealed
so i made a promise to myself
to say each day how much she means to me
and avoid that circumstance
where there's no second chance to tell her how i feel
if tomorrow never comes
will she know how much i loved her
did i try in every way to show her every day
that she's my only one
and if my time on earth were through
and she must face the world without me
is the love i gave her in the past
gonna be enough to last
if tomorrow never comes
so tell that someone that you love
just what you're thinking of
if tomorrow never comes 
you came when i was happy in your sunshine
i grew to love you more each passing day
before too long i built my world around you
and i prayed you'd love enough of me to stay
if you love me let me know
if you don't then let me go
i can't take another minute
of a day without you in it
if you love me let it be
if you don't then set me free
take the chains away
that keep me loving you
the arms that open wide to hold me closer
the hands that run their fingers through my hair
the smile that says hello it's good to see you 
anytime i turn around to find you there
it's this and so much more that make me love you
what else can i do to make you see
you know you have whatever's mine to give you
but a love affair for one can never be
if you love me let me know
if you don't then let me go
i can't take another minute
of a day without you in it
if you love me let it be
if you don't then set me free
take the chains away
that keep me loving you
take the chains away
that keep me loving you
loving you 
let me let you in on a secret
how to treat a woman right
if you're lookin' for a place in her heart
it ain't gonna happen overnight

to understand her deepest thoughts

i watch the way he looks at you
he don't see you like i do
i never speak the words i long to say
he don't know what he's got
is everything i'll ever want
i can't keep this inside one more day

if you were my girl my heart would shout your name out loud
i could conquer the world if you were my girl

things go from bad to worse
you'd think they can't get worse than that
and then they do
you still walk the straight and narrow
and you don't know where you are
use the needle of your compass
to sew up your broken heart
ask directions from a genie
in a bottle of jim beam
and she lies to you
that's when you learn the truth
if you're going through hell
keep on going don't slow down
if you're scared don't show it
you might get out
before the devil even knows you're there
well i been deep down in that darkness

felt a hundered different demons
breathing fire down my back
and i knew that if i stumbled
i'd fall right into the trap that they were laying yeah

holding out a hand to pull you back upon your feet

alabama lyrics
if you're gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
dan mitchellmurray kellum
if you're gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
that lead guitar is hot but not for louisiana man
so rosin up that bow for faded love and let's all dance
if you're gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
i remember down in houston we were puttin' on a show
when a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled cottoneyed joe
he said we love what you're doin' boys don't get us wrong
there's just somethin' missin' in your song
if you're gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
that lead guitar is hot but not for louisiana man
so rosin up that bow for faded love and let's all dance
if you're gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
so we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight
them texans raised the roof when jeff opened up his case
you say y'all all wanna twostep
you say ya wanna doesidoe
well here's your fiddlin' song before we go
if you're gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
that lead guitar is hot but not for louisiana man
so rosin up that bow for faded love and let's all dance
if you're gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
if you're gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
that lead guitar is hot but not for louisiana man
so rosin up that bow for faded love and let's all dance
if you're gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band 
if your heart ain't busy tonight
maybe it would like to get with mine
if your heart ain't busy tonight
i could keep it occupied for a long long time
if your lips ain't got something pressing to do
if your arms aren't held up they're invited too
if your heart ain't busy tonight
maybe it would like to get with mine anytime
well it's kind of you to lend me an ear
that's a start but i believe
if i could only get the rest of you over here
then all of you might fall in love with all of me
if your heart ain't busy tonight
maybe it would like to get with mine anytime
oh yeah
if your feet are restless for somewhere to go
and your eyes want something more to see
why don't you let them lead the rest of you to my door
so all of you can fall in love with all of me
if your heart ain't busy tonight
maybe it would like to get with mine
if your heart ain't busy tonight
i could keep it occupied for a long long time
yes i could
if your lips ain't got something pressing to do
if your arms aren't held up they're invited too
if your heart ain't busy tonight
maybe it would like to get with mine anytime
if your heart ain't busy tonight
maybe it would like to get with mineuh huh 
verse 1
every morning i watch you
walk into the office 
in your business suit
and matching shoes
with your hair pulled up neatly
you tug at your glasses
and you sit down
just three desks down
and i watch you in the florescent glare
and my mind drifts away somewhere
and i see
chours 
you
in a different light
your hair falling down
with love in your eyes
in my mind
you're a beautiful sight
i see you in a different light
just the way i saw you last night
verse 2
there's girls at the office
the guys always notice
when they walk by
but you're not the type
they don't know what i know
or somethings' just don't show
through tailored tweads
and that's fine with me
let them all think what they want to 
as for me when i look at you
i see
chours 
you
in a different light
your hair falling down
with love in your eyes
in my mind
you're a beautiful sight
i see you in a different light
just the way i saw you last night
chours 
baby it's you
in a different light
your hair falling down
with love in your eyes
in my mind
you're a beautiful sight
i see you in a different light
just the way i saw you last night 
x2 until fade 
there's room at my table why don't you pull up a seat
the music's inviting but i'm staying off of my feet
the floor's getting crowded but i don't wanna take part
i bet you can guess it's got someting to do with my heart

i could sure use your company now
but don't be mistaking my smile
i'm only in between dances
sitting it out for a while
the partners are chosen look at them waltzing away
the tempo gets slower closer and closer they sway
i've had my moments when i could get lost in the sound
but when the song ended the one in my arms let me down

have you been in my shoes
i serch your eyes for signs
will you remain remember my name
after closing time

i'm only in between dances
sitting it out for a while 
james slater
in my daughter's eyes i am a hero
i am strong and wise and i know no fear
but the truth is plain to see
she was sent to rescue me
i see who i wanna be
in my daughter's eyes
in my daughter's eyes everyone is equal
darkness turns to light and the
world is at peace
this miracle god gave to me gives me
strength when i am weak
i find reason to believe 
in my daughter's eyes
and when she wraps her hand
around my finger
oh it puts a smile in my heart
everything becomes a little clearer
i realize what life is all about
it's hangin' on when your heart
has had enough
it's giving more when you feel like giving up
i've seen the light
it's in my daughter's eyes
in my daughter's eyes i can see the future
a reflection of who i am and what will be
though she'll grow and someday leave
maybe raise a family
when i'm gone i hope you see how happy
she made me
for i'll be there
in my daughter's eyes 


i've got her photograph
on a stand by my bed
two on the mantel
and thousands in my head
i can't believe how fast she's growing
it ain't suppose to be like this
every time i look at her 
i see how much i've missed

i missed her first steps
her first words
i love you daddy
is something i seldom hear 
oh it hurts me so
to watch my girl grow
up in pictures
i send the money down
i do my best to do my part
but it can't compare
with what i pay with my heart
there's still unanswered questions
that weigh heavy on my mind
will she ever understand the reasons why

i missed her first steps
her first words
i love you daddy
is something i seldom hear 
oh it hurts me so
to watch my girl grow
up in pictures
it takes all i have 
to keep the tears inside
what i wouldn't give if
i could turn back time

i missed her first steps
her first words
i love you daddy
is something i seldom heard
oh it hurts me so
to watch my baby grow
up in pictures 
well she seemed all right by dawn's early light
though she looked a little worried and weak
she tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
but daddy left the proof on her cheek
and i was only eight years old that summer
and i always seemed to be in the way
so i took myself down to the fair in town 
on independence day
well word gets around in a small small town
they said he was a dangerous man
mama was proud and she stood her ground
she knew she was on the losin' end
some folks whispered some folks talked
but everybody looked the other way
when time ran out there was no one about
on independence day
let freedom ringlet the white dove sing
let the whole world know that today is a 
day of reckoning
let the weak be strong let the right be wrong
roll the stone away let the guilty pay 
it's independence day
well she lit up the sky that fourth of july
by the time that the firemen come
they just put out the flames
and took down some names
and sent me to the county home
now i ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong
but maybe it's the only way
talk about your revolution 
it's independence day
let freedom ringlet the white dove sing
let the whole world know that today is a 
day of reckoning
let the weak be strong let the right be wrong
roll the stone away let the guilty pay it's 
independence day
roll the stone away
it's independence day

baby tell me where'd you ever learn
to fight without saying a word
then waltz back into my life
like it's all gonna be alright
don't you know how much it hurts
when we don't talk
when we don't touch
when it doesn't feel like we're even in love
it matters to me
when i don't know what to say
don't know what to do
don't know of it really even matters to you
how can i make you see
it matters to me
baby i still don't understand
the distance between a woman and a man
so tell me how far it is
and how you can love like this
'cause i'm not sure i can
when we don't talk
when we don't touch
when it doesn't feel like we're even in love
it matters to me
when i dont know what to say
don't know what to do
don't know if it really even matters to you
how can i make you see
it matters to me
oh and i don't know what to say

oh it matters to me 
first i get cold and hot
think i'm on fire but i'm not
oh what a pain i've got
it must be love
there's nothing i can do
all that i want is you
look what i'm going through
it must be love
it must be love it must be love
i fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
you must be the dream i been dreaming of
oh what a feeling it must be love
something is wrong or right
i think of you all night
can't sleep 'til morning light
it must be love
seeing you in my dreams
holding you close to me
oh what else can it be
it must be love
it must be love it must be love
i fall like a sparrow and fly like a dove
you must be the dream i been dreaming of
oh what a feeling it must be love
repeat 4x decres on 4th time 
the only time i feel the pain
is in the sunshine or the rain
and i don't feel no hurt at all
unless you count when teardrops fall
i tell the truth 'cept when i lie
it only hurts me when i cry
you couldn't tell it by the smile
that my recovery took awhile
i worked for days and nights on end
just to walk and talk again
you can't believe the time it takes
to heal a heart once it breaks
the only time i feel the pain
is in the sunshine or the rain
and i don't feel no hurt at all
unless you count my teardrops fall
i tell the truth 'cept when i lie
it only hurts me when i cry
oh maybe every now and then
i have a small heartache again
you wouldn't know when you look at me
there's tiny scars that you can't see
it was a struggle to survive
i'm probably lucky i'm alive
the only time i feel the pain
is in the sunshine or the rain
and i don't feel no hurt at all
unless you count when teardrops fall
i tell the truth 'cept when i lie
and it only hurts me when i cry
i tell the truth 'cept when i lie
and it only hurts me when i cry 
with the alarm clock tingaling ringin' in my head 
i woke up dog tired beat down half dead 
tryin' to recover from another wild weekend 
chuggin' down coffee while i should have been sleepin' 
well it sure is monday idn't it now 
i gotta myself through the week somehow 
i had a ball friday saturday and sunday 
but it's all over now and it sure is monday 
oh i got to the job site at a quarter past nine 
and somehow i stayed awake till lunch time 
and then i caught a little nap stretched out in my truck bed 
my feet still twitchin' to the music in my head 
well it sure is monday ain't it the truth 
i partied too hardy now i'm payin' my dues 
i had a ball friday saturday and sunday 
but it's all over now and it sure is monday 
well it sure is monday ain't it a sin 
i gotta work my way through the week again 
i had a ball friday saturday and sunday 
but it's all over now and it sure is monday 
yeah it's all over now and it sure is monday 
she locked her fingers and bowed her head
she said i'm late and i'm really scared
you can go but i hope you stay
i'm gonna keep it either way
in my daddy's el camino
in her driveway in the rain
staring through the windshield
i could see my future change
and my heart hit like a hammer
and my thoughts were running wild
any fool can make a baby
it takes a man to raise a child
i laid my head down on the wheel
she said i know i know it don't seem real
she closed her eyes tears flowed through
she said don't hate me for loving you
in my daddy's el camino
in her driveway in the rain
staring through the windshield 
i could see my future change
and my heart hit like a hammer
and my thoughts were running wild
any fool can make a baby
it takes a man to raise a child
well i could not reassure her
i couldn't say what i had planned
couldn't put three words together
so i just took her hand
in my daddy's el camino
in her driveway in the rain
staring through the windshield
i could see my future change 
and my heart hit like a hammer
and my thoughts were running wild
any fool can make a baby
it takes a man to raise a child
it takes a man 
he didn't have to wake up
he'd been up all night
lying there in bed and listening
to his newborn baby cry
he makes a pot of coffee
he splashes water on his face
his wife gives him a kiss and says 
it's gonna be okay
it won't be like this for long
one day we'll look back laughing
at the week we brought her home
this phase is gonna fly by
so baby just hold on
it won't be like this for long
four years later 'bout 430
she's crawling in their bed
and when he drops her off at preschool
she's clinging to his leg
the teacher peels her off of him
he says what can i do
she says now don't you worry
this'll only last a week or two
it won't be like this for long
one day soon you'll drop her off
and she won't even know you're gone
this phase is gonna fly by
if you can just hold on
it won't be like this for long
someday soon she'll be a teenager
and at times he'll think she hates him
and he'll walk her down the aisle
and raise her veil 
but right now she's up and cryin'
and the truth is that he don't mind
as he kisses her goodnight
and she says her prayers
he lays down there beside her
'till her eyes are finally closed
and just watching her it breaks his heart
'cause he already knows
it won't be like this for long
one day soon that little girl is gonna be
all grown up and gone
and this phase is gonna fly by
so he's trying to hold on
it won't be like this for long
it won't be like this for long

the sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow

workday passes like molasses in wintertime
but it's july
gettin' paid by the hour and older by the minute
my boss just pushed me over the limit

if the phone's for me
you can tell them i just sailed away
and pour me something tall and strong
make it a hurricane before i go insane
it's only halfpast twelve but i don't care
it's five o'clock somewhere
i could pay off my tab
pour myself in a cab
and be back to work by two
at a moment like this
i can't help but wonder
what would jimmy buffett do
 jimmy buffett enters 
funny you should ask alan
i'd say pour me something tall and strong
make it a hurricane before i go insane
it's only half past twelve but i don't care
pour me something tall and strong

if i don't care
it's five o'clock somewhere
what time zone am i on
what country am i in

between the buoys i got it
alright well it's five o'clock let's go somewhere
i'm ready crank it up
lets get out of here
i'm gone 

spoken
back a few months ago i was headlinin' a great big nightclub
and they put me up a couple days early i came in a couple days early
and they put me up in what they call the star suite
now here i am headlinin' in one of the biggest nightclubs
in the country and i wake up at eight o'clock in the morning
in this star suite
all by myself
crowd awwww
mac yeah that's what i said awwwww
but i did what i've always done man to cheer myself up
i picked up my guitar i sat down and i wrote me a little song
now this is how it feels to be alone at the top of the hill
tryin' to figure out why
sung
 
oh lord it's hard to be humble
when you're perfect in every way
i can't wait to look in the mirror
cause i get better lookin' each day
to know me is to love me
i must be a hell of a man
oh lord it's hard to be humble
but i'm doin' the best that i can
i used to have a girlfriend
but i guess she just couldn't compete
with all of these lovestarved women
who keep clamoring at my feet
well i could probably find me another
but i guess they're all in awe of me
who cares i never get lonesome
cause i treasure my own company
ohhhhhh

i guess you could say i'm a loner
a cowboy outlaw tough and proud
well i could have lotsa friends if i wanted
but then i wouldn't stand out from the crowd
some folks say that i'm egotistical
hell i don't even know what that means
i guess it has something to do with the way
that i fill out my skintight blue jeans
ohhhhhh
come on where's all the kickers in here

one more time what are we doin'
we're doing the best that we can
give yourselves a hand
yeeeehaw 

people see us everywhere
they think you really care
but myself i can't deceive
i know it's only make believe
my one and only prayer
is that some day you'll care
my hopes my dreams come true
my one and only you
no one will ever know
how much i love you so
my only prayer will be
someday you'll care for me
but it's only make believe
my hopes my dreams come true

she was driving last friday on her way to cincinnati
on a snow white christmas eve
going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat
fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
it would been a long hard year
she had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
she was going way to fast
before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
she saw both their lives flash before her eyes
she didn't even have time to cry
she was sooo scared
she threw her hands up in the air
jesus take the wheel
take it from my hands
cause i can't do this all on my own
i'm letting go
so give me one more chance
to save me from this road i'm on
jesus take the wheel
it was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
and the car came to a stop
she cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
and for the first time in a long time
she bowed her head to pray
she said i'm sorry for the way
i've been living my life
i know i've got to change
so from now on tonight
jesus take the wheel
take it from my hands
cause i can't do this on my own
i'm letting go
so give me one more chance
to save me from this road i'm on
oh jesus take the wheel
oh i'm letting go
so give me one more chance
save me from this road i'm on
from this road i'm on
jesus take the wheel
oh take it take it from me
oh why oh 



it was two weeks after the day she turned 18
all dressed in white going to the church that night
she had his box of letters in the passenger seat
sixpence in her shoe
something borrowed something blue
and when the church doors opened up wide 
she put her veil down trying to hide the tears 
oh she just couldn't believe it 
she heard the trumpets from the military band 
and the flowers fell out of her hand
baby why'd you leave me why'd you have to go
i was counting on forever now i'll never know
i can't even breathe
it's like i'm looking from a distance standing in the background
everybody's saying he's not coming home now 
this can't be happening to me 
this is just a dream
the preacher man said let's bow our heads and pray
lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt
then the congregation all stood up and sang 
the saddest song that she ever heard 
and then they handed her a folded up flag 
and she held on to all she had left of him 
oh and what could've been 
and then the guns rang one last shot 
and it felt like a bullet in her heart
baby why'd you leave me why'd you have to go
i was counting on forever now i'll never know
i can't even breathe
it's like i'm looking from a distance standing in the background
everybody's saying he's not coming home now 
this can't be happening to me 
this is just a dream
oh
baby why'd you leave me why'd you have to go
i was counting on forever now i'll never know oh i'll never know
it's like i'm looking from a distance standing in the background
everybody's saying he's not coming home now 
this can't be happening to me 
this is just a dream
oh this is just a dream
this is just a dream
yeah yeah 

yeah yeah oh yeah
what condition my condition was in
i woke up this mornin'
with the sundown shinin' in
i found my mind in
a brown paper bag but then
i tripped on a cloud
and fell aeight miles high
i tore my mind on a jagged sky
i just dropped in to see
what condition my condition was in
yeah yeah oh yeah
what condition my condition was in
i pushed my soul in a deep dark hole
and then i followed it in
i watched myself crawlin' out
as i was crawlin' in
i got up so tight i couldn't unwind
i saw so much i broke my mind
i just dropped in to see
what condition my condition was in
yeah yeah oh yeah
what condition my condition was in
someone painted april fool
in big black letters on a dead end sign
i had my foot on the gas
as i left the road
and blew out my mind
eight miles outta memphis
and i got no spare
eight miles straight up
downtown somewhere
i just dropped in to see
what condition my condition was in
i said i just dropped in to see
what condition my condition was in
yeah yeah oh yeah 
you don't have to go now honey
call and tell 'em you won't be in today
baby there ain't nothin' at the office
so important it can't wait
i'm thankful for the weekend
but two days in heaven just ain't gonna do
this is gonna take forever darlin'
girl i just got started lovin' you
what's the point in fightin' what we're feelin'
we both know we'll never win
ain't this what we're missin'
let's just stop all this resistin' and give in
let me wrap my arms around you
you know you don't want to leave this room
come back and let me hold you darlin'
girl i just got started lovin' you
what can i say i've never felt this way
girl you're like a dream come true
after all the love we've made
it sure would be a shame
if we let this moment end so soon
so won't you lay back down beside me
girl just like i know you're wantin' to
trust me when i tell you darlin'
girl i just got started lovin' you
i'm thankful for the weekend
but two days in heaven just ain't gonna do
this is gonna take forever darlin'
girl i just got started lovin' you
come back and let me hold you darlin'
girl i just got started lovin' you 

i got miles of trouble spreadin' far and wide
bills on the table gettin' higher and higher
they just keep on comin' there aint no end in sight
i'm just holding on tight
i've got someone who loves me more then words can say
and i'm thankful for that each and every day
and if i count all my blessings i get a smile on my face
still hard to find faith
but if you look in my eyes
and tell me we'll be alright
if you promise never to leave you just might make me believe
its just day to day tryin' to make ends meet 
what id give for an address on easy street 
i need a deep margarita to help me unwind 
leave my troubles behind
but if you look in my eyes
and tell me we'll be alright
if you promise never to leave you just might make me believe
i used to believe in us 
when times got tough 
lately i'm afraid that even love is not enough
but if you can look in my eyes 
and tell me we'll be alright 
if you promise never to leave you just might make 
oh you just might make me 
you just might make me believe 
i got tired of losing
so i covered my tracks
i left love behind me
it was a thing of the past
and i got back on me feet again
with something new in my stride
i was just telling my girlfriends yesterday
how i was doing alright
i was living a good life
none of that silly love stuff
then i went and fell for you
ain't that just my luck
i got a house in the country
i got a garden that grows
and i got nobody telling me
hey turn down that radio
i made my life real simple
a couple cats and me
i don't get bored or lonely
as long as there's somethin' on tv
 
if i could win your heart you'd let me in your heart
i'd be so happy baby
just for these arms to be holding you close to me
there's nothing in this world i won't try
no limit to what i'd do to make you mine 'cause
i'd climb right up to the sky
take down the stars just to be in your arms baby
i'd go and capture the moon that's what i would do
just to hear you say that you love me
just to hear you say that you love me
if i could taste your kiss there'd be no sweeter gift
heaven could offer baby ooh

living to give you love
i'd walk across this world just to be
close to you 'cause i want you close to me yeah
i'd climb right up to the sky

when i hold you in my arms
ive got all ill ever need
thanks to the keeper of the stars
soft moonlight on your face oh how you shine
it takes my breath away
just to look into your eyes
i know i dont deserve a treasure like you
there really are no words
to show my gratitude
so i tip my hat to the keeper of the stars
he sure knew what he was doin
when he joined these two hearts
i hold everything
when i hold you in my arms
ive got all ill ever need
thanks to the keeper of the stars
it was no accident me finding you
someone had a hand in it
long before we ever knew 
we had a dog named bocephus living in the front yard
he liked sleeping out on top of the car
he drank beer out of a mason jar
and he'd climb up on everyone in bed
a wide frame house in a college town
a bunch of people always hanging around
no real problems we needed to drown
but we tried our best anyway
we went to class just to pass the time
back in '89
we had a keg in the closet pizza on the floor
left over from the night before
where we were going we didn't really care
we had all we ever wanted
in that keg in the closet
this old guitar taught me how to score
right there on that lambda chi porch
mary ann taught me a little more
about what one you can't have
sweatshirts and flag football
spring breaks down in panama
for a while we had it all
we never dreamed it wouldn't last
we went to class just to pass the time
back in '89
we had a keg in the closet pizza on the floor
left over from the night before
where we were going we didn't really care
we had all we ever wanted
in that keg in the closet
we all kind of went our separate ways
but i swear it seems like yesterday
keg in the closet pizza on the floor
left over from the night before
where we were going we didn't really care
we had all we ever wanted
in that keg in the closet 
there was a guy from pei they used to call potato
he met this young leamington ontario tomato
but he had eyes for other girls and she was a little mushy
so they said well let's get wed there's no sense bein' fussy
baked sized french fries how they love tomatoes
so dress 'em up with heinz ketchup 
ketchup loves potatoes 
ketchup loves potatoes
well he went down to windsor town to buy a ring on monday
saturday they said ok we'll cut the cake on sunday
but sunday came and what a shame they had no one to fetch it
without a cake they just sat and ate potato chips and ketchup
baked sized french fries how they love tomatoes
so dress 'em up with heinz ketchup 
ketchup loves potatoes 
ketchup loves potatoes
and so this guy from pei they used to call potato
he's got two boys and a little girl two spuds and one tomato
they romp and run around leamington and boy when they get hungry
the bottle drips all over the chips way down in the ketchup country
baked sized french fries how they love tomatoes
so dress 'em up with heinz ketchup 
ketchup loves potatoes 
ketchup loves potatoes 
my daddy always was a gentleman
never the kind who ever forced his hand
he would always be the last one to raise his voice
if anybody ever put us down
well you can bet that he would stand his ground
and he would tell me son sometimes you got no choice
you got to kick a little
cause a stir
sometimes you've gotta make some noise to be heard
if anybody ever tries to hold you back
you got to kick a little 
be tough
you got to let 'em know you've had enough
remember that unless you wanna finish last
you got to kick a little
some people ju
dge you by the way you look
they see you once and say you ain't no good
feels like they're never gonna take you for who you are
that's when you have to stand up and be strong
and go the extra mile to prove 'em all wrong
just remember when they push you way too far
you got to kick a little
cause a stir
sometimes you've gotta make some noise to be heard
if anybody ever tries to hold you back
you got to kick a little 
be tough
you got to let 'em know you've had enough
remember that unless you wanna finish last
you got to kick a little
you got to kick a little
cause a stir
sometimes you've gotta make some noise to be heard
if anybody ever tries to hold you back
you got to kick a little 
be tough
you got to let 'em know you've had enough
remember that unless you wanna finish last
you got to kick a little 

you were the first thing that i thought of 
when i thought i drank you off my mind 
when i get lost in the liquor 
you're the only one i find 
and if i did the things i oughta 
you still would not be mine 
so i'll keep a tight grip on the bottle 
gettin' loose and killin' time 
this killin' time is killin' me 
drinking myself blind thinkin' i won't see 
that if i cross that line and they bury me 
i just might find i'll be killin' time for eternity 
i don't know nothin' 'bout tomorrow 
i've been lost in yesterday 
i've spent all my life just dying for a love that passed away 
and if there's an end to all my sorrow 
and this is the only price i'll pay i'll be a happy man when i go 
and i can't wait another day

and everytime they ask me why i just smile and say
you've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
and let her know you think about her when you're gone
kiss an angel good mornin' and love her like a devil when you get back home
well people may try to guess the secret of happiness
but some of them never learn it's a simple thing
the secret i'm speaking of is a woman and a man in love
and the answer is in the song that i always sing
you've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
kiss an angel good mornin'

last night i got served a little too much of that poison baby
last night i did things i'm not proud of
and i got a little crazy
last night i met a guy on the dance floor and i let him call me baby
and i don't even know his last name
my momma would be so ashamed
it started off hey cutie where you from
and then it turned into oh no what have i done
and i don't even know his last name
we left the club right around 3 o'clock in the morning
his pinto sitting there in the parking lot well it should have been a warning
i had no clue what i was getting into
so i'll blame it on the cuervo
oh where did my manners go
and i don't even know his last name
my momma would be so ashamed
it started off hey cutie where you from
and then it turned into oh no what have i done
and i don't even know his last name
here we go
today i woke up thinking about elvis somewhere in vegas
i'm not sure how i got here
or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
i gotta go take the chips and the pinto and hit the road
they say what happens here stays here all of this will disappear
there's just one little problem
i don't even know my last name
my momma would be so ashamed
it started off hey cutie where you from
and then it turned into oh no what have i done
and i don't even know my last name
what have i done
what have i done
what have i done
oh what have i done
i don't even know my last name
well it turned into oh no what have i done
and i don't even know my last name
yea yeah yeah
it started off hey cutie where you from
and then it turned into oh no what have i done
and i don't even know my last name
oh yeah 

going through my closet the other day
found an old yearbook flipped right to the page
of that senior trip down there on that panama strip
we all started yelling when we smelled the beach
just couldn't wait to try our fake ids
we only had a few days and a whole lot of memories to make
oh man we were livin didn't waste one minute
we talked and drank and danced and said goodbye
we laughed until we cried
this past year my family
was sittin crosslegged 'round the christmas tree
listenin to granddad we all knew it would probably be his last
he was crackin jokes and we were takin turns
tellin stories bout fishing or lessons learned
out on the porch with him we all felt like kids again
oh man we were livin sittin' there reminiscin'
yeah we sang and talked and traveled back in time
we laughed until we cried
it's like the best days under the sun
every emotion rolled into one
a little of this a little of that
kinda happy kinda sad
just the other night the baby was cryin
so i got out of bed rocked her awhile and i held her tight
and i told her it would be all right
my mind went back to a few years ago
we tried so long we almost gave up hope
and i remember you comin' in and tellin me the news
oh man we were livin goin crazy in the kitchen
we danced and screamed and held each other tight
we laughed until we cried
although the cd cover says oh man were livin i'll never forget it
we danced and kissed and thanked the lord that night 

you're not sure that you love me
but you're not sure enough to let me go
baby it ain't fair you know
you just keep me hanging round
you say you don't wanna hurt me
don't wanna see my tears
so why are you still standing here
just watching me drown

and it's alright yeah i'll be fine
don't worry about this heart of mine
just take your love and hit the road
there's nothing you can do or say
you're gonna break my heart anyway
so just leave the pieces when you go
now you can drag out the heartache
baby you can make it quick
really get it over with and just let me move on
don't concern yourself with this mess you left for me
i can clean it up you see just as long as your gone

you not making up your mind
is killing me and wasting time
i need so much more than that

leave the pieces when you go
leave the pieces when you go
leave the pieces when you go 
all my bags are packed i'm ready to go
i'm standing here outside your door
i hate to wake you up to say goodbye
but the dawn is breaking it's early morn
the taxi's waiting he's blowin' his horn
already i'm so lonesome i could die
so kiss me and smile for me
tell me that you'll wait for me
hold me like you'll never let me go
'cause i'm leaving on a jet plane
don't know when i'll be back again
oh babe i hate to go
there's so many times i've let you down
so many times i've played around 
i tell you now they don't mean a thing

i thought it was over baby
we said our goodbyes
but i can't go a day without your face going through my mind
in fact not a single minute
passes without you in it
your voice your touch
memories of your love are with me all of the time
let me let go baby
let me let go
if this is for the best why are you still in my heart
are you still in my soul
let me let go
i talked to you the other day
oh looks like you made your escape
you put us behind
no matter how i try i can't do the same
let me let go baby won't you
let me let go
it just isn't right i've been two thousand miles
down a deadend road
let me let go
the lights of this strange city are shining
but they don't hold no fascination for me
i try to find the bright side baby
but everywhere i look
everywhere i turn
you're all i see
let me
let me let go baby won't you
let me let go
it just isn't right i've been two thousand miles
down a deadend road
oh let me let go darlin' won't you
i just gotta know
if this is for the best why are you still in my heart
you're still in my soul
let me let go why don't you
let me let go
let me let go 
it's been a long time comin'
as you shed a lonesome tear
and now you're in a wonderama
i wonder what you're doin' here
the flame no longer flickers
you're feeling just like a fool
you keep staring into your liquor
wondering what to do
i don't hardly know you
but i'd be willing to show you
i know a way to make you smile
let me touch you for awhile
i'm gonna ruin my black mascara
you're drinking whiskey when it should be wine
you keep looking into that mirror
but to me you're looking really fine
i don't hardly know you
but i'd be willing to show you
i know a way to make you
laugh at that cowgirl as she's walking out your door                    
i know a way to make you smile
just let me whisper things
you've never heard before
just let me touch you baby
just let me touch you for a while
i don't hardly know you
but i'd be willing to show you
i know a way to make you smile
it's been a long time
let me touch you for a while 
mary was married with children
had the perfect suburban life
'til her husband came clean with the help of jim beam
and confessed all his sins one night
said he'd fallen in love with a barmaid
said she made him feel reckless and young
and when he got through what else could she do
she just let that pony run

'cause you do what you gotta do
and you know what you know
you hang on till you can't hang on
then you learn to let go
you get what you want sometimes
but when it's all said and done
you do what you gotta do
then you let that pony run
now mary moved to west virginia
after the shock wore off
she got a divorce and a chestnut horse
and a barn with an old hayloft
sometimes she rides down by the river
said it makes her feel reckless and young
she just closes her eyes and she holds on tight
and she lets that pony run
 
there's a reason for the sunshinin' sky
and there's a reason why i'm feelin' so high
must be the season when that love light shines all around us
so let that feelin' grab you deep inside
and send you reelin' where your love can't hide
and then go stealin' through the moonlit nights with your lover
just let your love flow like a mountain stream
and let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
and let your love show and you'll know what i mean
it's the season
letyour love fly like a bird on wing
and let your love bind you to all livin' things
and let your love shine and you'll know what i mean
that's the reason
there's a reason for the warm sweet nights
and there's a reason for the candlelights
must be the season when those love lights shine all around us
so let that wonder take you into space
and lay you under its loving embrace
just feel the thunder as it warms your face
you can't hold back
just let your love flow like a mountain stream
and let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
and let your love show and you'll know what i mean
it's the season
let your love fly like a bird on wing
and let your love bind you to all livin' things
and let your love shine and you'll know what i mean
that's the reason

if i could write a letter to me
and send it back in time 
to myself at seventeen
first i'd prove it's me by saying
look under your bed
there's a skoal can and a playboy
no one else would know you hid
and then i'd say i know it's tough
when you break up after seven months
and yeah i know you really liked her
and it just don't seem fair
but all i can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare
and oh you got so much goin' for you going right
but i know at seventeen it's hard to see past friday night
she wasn't right for you
and still you feel like there's a knife sticking out of your back
and you're wondering if you'll survive
you'll make it through this and you'll see
you're still around to write this letter to me
at the stop sign at tomlinson and 8th
always stop completely don't just tap your brakes
and when you get a date with bridget
make sure the tank is full
on second thought forget it
that one turns out kinda cool
each and every time you have a fight
just assume you're wrong and dad is right
and you should really thank ms brinkman
she spends so much extra time
it's like she sees the diamond underneath
and she's polishing you 'til you shine
and oh you got so much going for you going right
but i know at seventeen it's hard to see past friday night
tonight's the bonfire rally
but you're staying home instead
because if you fail algebra mom and dad'll kill you dead
but trust me you'll squeak by and get a c
and you're still around to write this letter to me
you've got so much up ahead
you'll make new friends
and you should see your kids and wife
and i'll end by saying
have no fear
these are nowhere near the best years of your life
i guess i'll see you in the mirror
when you're a grown man
ps go hug aunt rita every chance you can
and oh you got so much goin' for you goin' right
but i know at seventeen it's hard to see past friday night
i wish you'd study spanish
i wish you'd take a typin' class
i wish you wouldn't worry and let it be
hey i'd say have a little faith and you'll see
if i could write a letter to me
to me 
life ain't always beautiful 
sometimes it's just plain hard 
life can knock you down it can break your heart 
life ain't always beautiful 
you think you're on your way 
and it's just a dead end road at the end of the day 
but the struggle makes you stronger 
and the changes make you wise 
and happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time 
no life ain't always beautiful 
tears will fall sometimes 
life ain't always beautiful but it's a beautiful ride 
life ain't always beautiful 
some days i miss your smile 
i get tired of walkin' all these lonely miles 
and i wish for just one minute 
i could see your pretty face 
guess i can dream but life don't work that way 
but the struggles makes me stronger 
and the changes make me wise 
and happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time 
no life ain't always beautiful 
but i know i'll be fine 
hey life ain't always beautiful but its a beautiful ride 
what a beautiful ride 
we're tied to our memories they won't let us stray

we start getting older the moment we live 
look over your shoulder 
there's hindsight to give 
come good days and bad days 
the sun's gonna rise 
so why look beyond what's in front of your eyes

whooo umm yeah
life's like a road that you travel on
when there's one day here and the next day gone
sometimes you bend sometimes you stand
sometimes you turn your back to the wind
there's a world outside ev'ry darkened door
where blues won't haunt you anymore
where the brave are free and lovers soar
come ride with me to the distant shore
we won't hesitate
to break down the garden gate
there's not much time left today
life is a highway
i wanna ride it all night long
if you're going my way

through all these cities and all these towns

when i was fourteen i was fallin' fast
for a blueeyed girl in my homeroom class
tryin to find the courage to ask her out 
was like tryin' to get oil from a water spout
what she would've said i can't say
i never did ask then she moved away
i learned something from my blueeyed girl
sink or swim you gotta give it a whirl

life's a dance you learn as you go
sometimes you lead sometimes you follow
don't worry 'bout what you don't know
life's a dance you learn as you go
the longer i live the more i believe 
you do have to give if you wanna receive
there's a time to listen a time to talk
and you might have to crawl even after you walk
had sure things blow up in my face
seen the longshot win the race
been knocked down by the slammin' door
picked myself up and came back for more
3x
life's a dance
life's a dance
life's a dance
take a chance on love
life's a dance
you learn as you go

aaron linessteven dale jones
they're not really expecting me
but i know where they hide the key under the welcome mat
there's no better place than that
don't know how long i've been gone
all i know is it's been too long and i'm off track
that's why i'm coming back
when i see the lights of my hometown
i feel like the world stops spinning 'round
everything makes sense
maybe it's the innocence
i know it's just a few miles down the road
i'm getting there as fast as i can go
i can always find peace of mind
in the lights of my hometown
the static is almost gone
from the station i grew up on
i'm getting closer now
so i turn it up real loud
funny how a little thing like that
can make it all come rushing back
they say it's not the same
but to me it will never change
when i see the lights of my hometown
i feel like the world stops spinning 'round
everything makes sense
maybe it's the innocence
i know it's just a few miles down the road
i'm getting there as fast as i can go
i can always find peace of mind
in the lights of my hometown
and though i've said goodbye
the best of me still lies inside
that city limit sign
i know it's just a few miles down the road
i'm getting there as fast as i can go
i can always find peace of mind
in the lights of my hometown
my hometown 

i never liked the rain until i walked through it with you 
every thunder cloud that came was one more i might not get through 
on the darkest day there's always light and now i see it too 
but i never liked the rain until i walked through it with you 
i hear it falling in the night and filling up my mind 
all the heaven's rivers come to light and i see it all unwind 
i hear it talking through the trees and on the window pane 
and when i hear it i just can't believe 
i never liked the rain 
like the rain i have fallen for you and 
i know just why you liked the rain always calling for you 
i'm falling for you now 
just like the rain 
when the cloud is rolling over thunder striking me 
it's as bright as lightning and i wonder why i couldn't see 
that it's always good and when the flood is gone we still remain 
guess i've known all along i just belong here with you falling 
like the rain i have fallen for you and 
i know just why you liked the rain always calling for you 
i'm falling for you now just like the rain 
i have fallen for you i'm falling for you know just like the rain 
and when the night falls on our better days 
and we're looking to the sky 
for the winds to take us high above the plains 
i know that we'll find better ways 
to look into the eye of the storms that will be calling 
forever we'll be falling like the rain i have fallen for you 
and i know just why you like the rain always calling for you 
i'm falling for you now just like the rain 
i have fallen for you and i know just why you 
like the rain always calling for you 
i'm falling for you now just like the rain 
i have fallen for you and 
i know just why you like the rain always calling for you 
i'm falling for you now just like the rain 
like the rain 
like the rain 
like the rain 
like the rain 
like the rain

a little white house in the heart of town
on a little sad street just a little run down
became a home for bill and sue 
two newlyweds who did the best that they could do
and when they brush each other passin' in the hall 
sue would smile and say this place is pretty small
but you know love grows best in little houses 
with fewer walls to separate
where you eat and sleep so close together
you can't help but communicate 
oh and if we had more room between us think of all we'd miss
love grows best in houses just like this
before too long sue and bill 
were makin' plans for jack and jill
oh happy day when the news came in 
but what to do when they found out sue was having twins
when they could not pass each other in the hall 
well sue would smile and say this place is really really small 
but you know love grows best in little houses 
with fewer walls to separate
where you eat and sleep so close together
you can't help but communicate 
oh and if we had more room between us think of all we'd miss
love grows best in houses just like this
that little white frame house still keeps them warm 
though it's been thirtytwo years since the kids were born 
and when they look back now they hold each other tight 
and whisper in each other's ears you know you were right 
because love grows best in little houses 
with fewer walls to separate
where you eat and sleep so close together
you can't help but communicate 
oh and if we had more room between us think of all we'd miss
love grows best in houses just like this
yeah love grows best in houses just like this 
i remember walk'in round the court square sidewalk
lookin' in windows at things i couldn't want 
there's johnson's hardware and morgans jewelry
and the ol' lee king's apothecary
they ware the little man
the little man
i go back now and the stores are empty
except for an old coke sign dated 1950
boarded up like they never existed
or renovated and called historic districts
there goes the little man
there goes the little man
now the court square's just a set of streets
that the people go round but they seldom think
bout the little man that built this town
before the big money shut em down
and killed the little man
oh the little man
he pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
and one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
the new stores came where you do it yourself
you buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf
forget the little man
forget about that little man
he hung on there for a few more years
but he couldn't sell slurpees
and he wouldn't sell beer
now the bank rents the station
to a man down the road
and they sell velvet elvis and
secondhand clothes
there goes little man
there goes another little man
now the court square's just a set of streets
that the people go round but they seldom think
bout the little man that built this town
before the big money shut em down
and killed the little man
oh the little man
now the stores are lined up in a concrete strip
you can buy the whole world in just one trip
and save a penny cause it's jumbo size
they don't even realize
they'er killin' the little man
oh the little man
now the court square's just a set of streets
that the people go round but they seldom think
bout the little man that built this town
before the big money shut em down
and killed the little man
oh the little man
it wasn't long ago when i was a child
an old black man came with his mule and his plow
he broke the ground where we grew our garden
back before we'd all forgoten
about the little man
the little man
long live the little man 
god bless the little man

oh oh i love her so
stand back give her room boys and watch her go
she's a looker heads turn when she comes through the door
a show stopper when she gets to goin' out on the floor
we leave all our troubles and cares way behind us
i feel like i'm a king when i'm out with her highness
i'm her big cat daddy she's my little miss honky tonk
oh oh i love her so
stand back give her room boys and watch her go
we leave all our troubles and cares way behind us

i'm her big cat daddy she's my little miss honky tonk 

well i'll never forget the first time that i heard
that pretty mouth say that dirty word
and i can't even remember now
what she backed my truck into
but she covered her mouth and her face got red
and she just looked so darn cute
that i couldn't even act like i was mad
yeah i live for little moments like that
that's like just last year on my birthday
she lost all track of time and burnt the cake
and every smoke detector in the house was going off
she was just about to cry until i took her in my arms
and i tried not to let her see me laugh
yeah i live for little moments like that
i know she's not perfect
but she tries so hard for me
and i thank god that she isn't
'cause how boring would that be
it's the little imperfections
it's the sudden change of plans
when she misreads the directions
and we're lost but holding hands
yeah i live for little moments like that
when she's laying on my shoulder 
on the sofa in the dark
and about the time she falls asleep
so does my right arm
and i want so bad to move it
because it's tingling and it's numb
she looks so much like an angel
that i don't want to wake her up
yeah i live for little moments
when she steals my heart again
and doesn't even know it
yeah i live for little moments like that 
little sister don't you little sister don't you
little sister don't you kiss me once or twice
tell me that's it nice and then you run
yeah yeah little sister don't you do what your big sister done

and along came jim dandy
and they slipped right out the door

from your head down to your toes

you've got your little ways to hurt me
you know just how to tear me up
and leave me in small pieces on the ground
you've got your little ways to hurt me
they're not too big but they're real tough
just one cold look from you can knock me down
to look at you and me no one would ever know
the pain that i've endured 'cause i won't let it show
my friends would laugh out loud if they only knew
the truth about how i am just your lovesick fool
'cause you've got your little ways to hurt me
you know just how to tear me up
and leave me in small pieces on the ground
and you've got your little ways to hurt me
they're not too big but they're real tough
just one cold look from you can knock me down
the sadness in my eyes should somehow be a clue
but no one here would ever suspect sweet little you
there've been rumors of the truth but i've kept it quiet
'cause i'm too ashamed to let them know you make me cry
and you've got your little ways to hurt me
you know just how to tear me up
and leave me in small pieces on the ground
you've got your little ways to hurt me
they're not too big but they're real tough
just one cold look from you can knock me down
yeah your little ways can knock me to the ground 




two young people without a thing
say some vows and spread their wings
settle down with just what they need
livin' on love
she don't care 'bout what's in style
she just likes the way he smiles
it takes more than marble and tile
livin' on love
livin' on love buyin' on time
without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
just like an old fashion story book rhyme
livin' on love
it sounds simple that's what you're thinkin'
but love can walk through fire without blinkin'
it doesn't take much when you get enough
livin' on love
two old people without a thing
children gone but still they sing
side by side in that front porch swing
livin' on love
he can't see anymore
she can barely sweep the floor
hand in hand they'll walk through that door
just livin' on love
livin' on love buyin' on time
without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
just like an old fashion story book rhyme
livin' on love
it sounds simple that's what you're thinkin'
but love can walk through fire without blinkin'
it doesn't take much when you get enough
livin' on love
no it doesn't take much when you get enough
livin' on love 


the body's a temple that's what we're taught
i've treated this one like an old honkytonk
greasy cheeseburgers and cheap cigarettes
one day they'll get me if they ain't got me yet
'cause i'm living in fast forward
a hillbilly rock star out of control
i'm living in fast forward
now i need to rewind real slow
my friends all grew up they settled down
built nice little houses on the outskirts of town
they work in their office drive suv's
they pray for their babies and they worry 'bout me
'cause i'm living in fast forward
a hillbilly rock star out of control
i'm living in fast forward
now i need to rewind real slow
i'm always runnin'
son of a gunnin'
i've had a good time it's true
but the way i've been goin'
it's time that i toned it
down just a notch or two
oh yeah
well i'm living in fast forward
a hillbilly rock star out of control
i'm living in fast forward
now i need to rewind real slow
well i'm living in fast forward
a hillbilly rock star out of control
i'm living in fast forward
now i need to rewind real slow
yeah i need to rewind real slow
yeah i still got some miles to go 
give us your tired your weak
and we will make them strong
bring us your far off song
and we will sing along
leave us your broken dreams
we'll give them time to mend
there's still a lot of love
living in the promiseland
living in the promiseland
our dreams are made of steels
the prayer of every one
to know how freedom feels
there is a winding road
across shifting sand
and room for everyone
living in the promiseland
so they came with such a sad eye
nameless woman faceless child
like a bad dream
till there was no room at all
no place to place to run
and no place to fall
give us your daily bread
we have no shoes to wear
no place to call our home
only this cross to bear
we are the multitudes
lend us a helping hand
is there no love anymore
living in the promiseland
guitar solo
living in the promiseland
our dreams are made of steels
the prayer of every man
know how freedom feels
there is a winding road
across the shifting sand
and room for everyone
living in the promiseland
and room for everyone
living in the promiseland  


daddy sits on the front porch swingin'
looking out on a vacant field
used to be filled with barley n' tobacco
now he knows it never will
my brother found work in indiana
sister's a nurse at the old folks' home
mama's still cooking too much for supper
and me i been a long time gone
been a long time gone
no i ain't hoed a row since i don't know when
long time gone
and it ain't comin' back again
delia plays that old church piano
sittin' out on her daddy's farm
she always thought that we'd be together
lord i never meant to do her harm
said she could hear me singing in the choir
me i heard another song
i caught wind and hit the road runnin'
and lord i been a long time gone
been a long time gone
lord i ain't had a prayer since i don't know when
long time gone
and it ain't comin' back again
now me i went to nashville
trying to be the big deal
playing down on broadway
getting there the hard way
living from a tip jar
sleeping in my car
hocking my guitar
yeah i'm gonna be a star
now me and deliah
singing every sunday
watching the children and the garden grow
listen to the radio to hear what's cooking
but the music ain't got no soul
now they sound tired but they don't sound haggard
they got money but they don't have cash
they got junior but they don't have hank
i think i think i think the rest is
a long time gone
no i ain't hit the roof since i don't know when
long time gone
and it ain't coming back 
i said a long time gone
no i ain't honked a horn since i don't know when
long time gone
and it ain't coming back again
i said a long time long time long time gone
whoa it's been a long time
long time long time long time gone
oh it's been a long time gone
long time long time long time gone 
it's a long trip alone over sand and stone
that lie along the road that we all must travel down
so maybe you could walk with me a while
and maybe i could rest beneath your smile
everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
'cause it's a long trip alone
it's a short piece of time but just enough to find
a little peace of mind under the sun somewhere
so maybe you could walk with me a while
and maybe i could rest beneath your smile
you know we can't afford to let one moment pass us by
'cause it's a short piece of time
and i don't know where i'd be without you here
'cause i'm not really me without you there
yea yeah
hallelujah hallelujah oh
so maybe you could walk with me a while
maybe i could rest beneath your smile
everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
so maybe you could walk with me a while
maybe i could rest beneath your smile
maybe i could feel you right beside me 'til i'm home
'cause it's a long trip alone 
my friends from high school
married their high school boyfriends
moved into houses 
in the same zip codes where their parents live
but i i could never follow
no i i could never follow
i hit the highway 
in a pink rv with stars on the ceiling
lived like a gypsy
six strong hands on the steering wheel
i've been a long time gone now
maybe someday someday i'm gonna settle down
but i've always found my way somehow
by taking the long way
taking the long way around
taking the long way
taking the long way around
i met the queen of whatever
drank with the irish and smoked with the hippies
moved with the shakers
wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to
no i i could never follow
no i i could never follow
it's been two long years now
since the top of the world came crashing down
and i'm getting it back on the road now
but i'm taking the long way
taking the long way around
taking the long way
taking the long way around
oh i'll just take my time i won't lay down
and take the long way around
well i fought with a stranger and i met myself
i opened my mouth and i heard myself
it can get pretty lonely when you show yourself
guess i could have made it easier on myself
but i i could never follow
no i i could never follow
well i never seem to do it like anybody else
maybe someday someday i'm gonna settle down
if you ever want to find me i can still be found
taking the long way
taking the long way around
taking the long way
taking the long way around
i'm taking the long way
taking the long way around
i'm taking the long way
taking the long way around
i'm taking the long way
taking the long way around
i'm taking the long way
taking the long way around 
found an old box in the bottom of the closet
'neath a bowling ball bag full of magazines
had a school sweater with a ring in the pocket
from my first cigar  man did i turn green
hey honey come look at what i just found
this old picture of us when the carnival came to town
i was superman tarzan
thought i was a star in a rock n roll band
you were lois lane lady jane
i wasn't very good
but you were the biggest fan of the man
that your momma warned you not to trust
now baby look at us
there's a bracelet i made you at your homecoming party
bought a sixpack of bud just to get tabs
took you home and you wore it proudly
but i got in big trouble when you showed your dad
here's a speaker from the dickson drivein show
what movie was playing we never did know
i was superman tarzan
thought i was a star in a rock n roll band
you were lois lane lady jane
i wasn't very good
but you were the biggest fan of the man
that your momma warned you not to trust
and baby look at us
you were the biggest fan of the man
that your momma warned you not to trust
and baby look at us
i was superman tarzan
you were lois lane lady jane
yeah and baby look at us
look at us 
look at us
after all these years together
look at us
after all that we've been through
look at us
still leaning on each other
if you want to see
how true love should be
then just look at us
look at you
still pretty as a picture
look at me
still crazy over you
look at us
still believin' in forever

in a hundred years from now
i know without a doubt
they'll all look back and wonder how
we made it all work out
chances are
we'll go down in history
when they want to see
how true love should be
they'll just look at us 
hope they never end this song
this could take us all night long
i looked at the moon and i felt blue
then i looked again and i saw you
eyes like fire in the night
bridges burning with their light
now i want to spend the whole night through
and honey yes i'd like to spend it all on you
love look what you've done to me
never thought i'd fall again so easily
oh love you wouldn't lie to me
leading me to feel this way

they might fade and turn to stone
let's get crazy all alone
hold me closer than you'd ever dare
close your eyes and i'll be there
after all is said and done
after all you are the one
take me up your stairs and through the door
take me where we don't care anymore
love look what you've done to me
never thought i'd fall again so easily
oh love you wouldn't lie to me would you
leading me to feel this way

love look what you've done to me
never thought i'd fall again so easily
oh love you wouldn't lie to me
leading me to feel this way 


i never cared about the car i'd drive
or the room i'd sleep or the bus i'd ride
just as long as i could get somewhere
and not get hurt i could breathe out there
i knew i could be free out there  could be me
i never cared about the word prestige
about no inside track or no noblesse oblige
just as long as i could pay my way
and pull my weight and say my say
as long as i could pay my way  i could say
bridge
i never had no plans just dreams and vague directions
i would not make my stand
i the house of corrections
now i can see at last i see that everything is changing
and if you want to hold on fast the future needs arranging

now i'm looking forward to you
now i'm looking forward to you
my former view was backward
my backward view as blue
now i'm looking forward to you
love had a weight designed to bring me down
my hands would sweat and my heart would pound
now i've learned it and i've turned around
and i hanker for that anchor sound
i hanker for that anchor sound
once designed to bring me down
repeart bridge   
close your eyes baby follow my heart 
call on the mem'ries here in the dark
we'll let the magic take us away
back to the feeling we shared when they'd play

in the still of the night hold me darling 
hold me tight oh shoodoop shoobe do 
shoodoop doo so real so right
lost in the fifties tonight
these precious hours we know we can't survive
love's all that matters while the past is alive
now and for always till time disappears
we'll hold each other whenever we hear

in the still of the night hold me darling
hold me tight oh shoodoop shoobe do
shoodoop doo so real so right
lost in the fifties tonight 
i see your momma and the candles and tears and roses 
i see your daddy walk his daughter down the isle 
i feel my knees start to tremble as i tell the preacher 
don't she look beautiful tonight 
all the wonderful words in my head i've been thinking 
you know i want to say 'em all just right 
i lift your veil and angels start singing 
such a heavenly sight 
 
lost in this moment with you 
i am completely consumed 
my feelings so absolute there's no doubt 
sealing our love with a kiss 
waitin' my whole life for this 
watching all my dreams come true 
lost in this moment with you 
i smell the jasmine floating in the air like a love song 
watch my words draw sweet tears from your eyes 
bow our heads while the preacher talks to jesus 
please bless this brand new life 
 x 2
lost in the moment in the moment in this moment with you 
lost in the moment yeah 
lost in the moment in the moment in this moment with you 
lost in the moment 
these old boots still got a lot of ground
they ain't covered yet
there's at least another million miles
under these old bus treads
so if you think i'm gonnna settle down
iëve got news for you
i still got a lot of leavin' left to do
and as long as there's a song 
left in this old guitar
this life i'm bound to lead
ain't for the faint of heart
so you won't fall for me
if you know what's good for you
ëcause i still got a lot of leavin' left to do
i guess the lord made me hard to handle
so lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
so before you go and turn me on
be sure that you can turn me loose
ëcause i still got a lot of leavin' left to do
girl you look like you might be an angel
so i won't lie
i could love you like the devil
if you wanted me to tonight
and we could talk about forever for a day or two
but i still got a lot of leavin' left to do
i guess the lord made me hard to handle
so lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
so before you go and turn me on
be sure that you can turn me loose
ëcause i still got a lot of leavin' left to do
yeah i still got a leavin' left to do 
i'd gladly walk across the desert
with no shoes upon my feet
to share with you the last bite
of bread i had to eat
i would swim out to save you
in your sea of broken dreams
when all your hopes are sinkin'
let me show you what love means

love can build a bridge
between your heart and mine
love can build a bridge
don't you think it's time
don't you think it's time
i would whisper love so loudly
every heart could understand
that love and only love
can join the tribes of man
i would give my heart's desire
so that you might see
the first step is to realize
that it all begins with you and me

when we stand together
it's our finest hour
we can do anything anything
keep believin' in the power

love and only love
love and only love 
well this heart 'a mine
has been hardened like a stone
it might take some time
to get back what is gone
but i'm movin' on
and you don't hold my dreams
like you did before
oh and i will curse your name
hey
well i heard the news
that you were back in town
and just passin' through
to claim your lost and found
but i'm over you
and there ain't nothin' there
that you could say or do
and take what you did back
you've got nerve to waltz right in
and claim what's mine is yours again

'cause i been doin' fine without you
forgettin' all the love we once knew
and girl i ain't the one that slammed that door
whoa should'a know
now you see a change of thinkin'
well but i ain't got a heart for breakin' up
so go and pick your bags up off my floor
oh 'cause love don't live here anymore
oh no
that love don't live here anymore
well baby you can try
to tell me how it is
and try to justify
everything you did
but honey i'm no fool
oh and i been down this road
too many times with you
now i think it's best you go
well i got one thing left to say
is you can lay in the bed you made

well oh no
should've known no
you don't live here anymore
love don't live here anymore
since you walked out of my door
love don't live here
love don't live here girl
well love don't live here anymore 

life was going great

that love gets me every time
my heart changed my mind
and i gol' darn gone and done it hoo

life was goin' great
well i gol' darn gone and done it 
i once though of love as a prison
a place i didn't want to be
so long ago i made a decision
to be footloose and fancyfree
but you came and i was so tempted
to gamble on love just one time
i never thought that i would get caught
it seemed like a perfect crime
baby you left me defenseless
but i've only got one plea
lock me away inside of your love
and throw away the key
i'm guilty of love in the first degree
i thought it would be so simple
like a thousand times before
i'd take what i wanted and just walk away
but i never made it to the door
now babe i'm not begging for mercy
go ahead and throw the book at me
if lovin' you's a crime
i know that i'm as guilty as a man can be
baby you left me defenseless
but i've only got one plea
lock me away inside of your love
and throw away the key
i'm guilty of love in the first degree
love in the first degree
oh yeah
oh yeah
baby you left me defenseless
but i've only got one plea
lock me away inside of your love
and throw away the key
i'm guilty of love in the first degree
love in the first degree
oh yeah
love in the first degree
love in the first degree
oh yeah
love in the first degree
love in the first degree
love in the first degree
love in the first degree 
love ain't a candle
it doesn't burn for one night
and need the dark to shine
love is alive
and love ain't just a word
in every dictionary
with no where defined
love is a man and he's mine

love is alive
and at our breakfast table
everyday of the week
love is alive
and it grows everyday and night
even in our sleep
love is alive
and it's made a happy woman out of me
oh love is alive
and here by me
love ain't just a mood
a distant far away dream
that needs the night to rise
love is alive
and love ain't just a song
sweet words of music
to go dancin' by
love is a man and he's mine

love is alive here by me
repeat and fade 
every now and then when the world steps in
stealin' all our time away
it soon takes so much we forget to touch
that's when i know it's time for me to say
take my hand let's walk through love's door
and be free from the world once more
here's my arms we can hide today
and love the world away
once again we'll be where our hearts are free
and the time is ours to share
love will always stay just a touch away
come with me all the magic's waiting there
take my hand let's walk through love's door
and be free from the world once more
here's my heart we can hide today
and love the world away
we can love the world away 
sometimes think that war is necessary
every night i pray for peace on earth
i hand out my dollars to the homeless
but believe that every able soul should work
my father gave me my shotgun
that i'll hand down to my son
try to teach him everything it means
i'm a man of my convictions
call me wrong
call me right
but i bring my better angels to every fight
you may not like where i'm goin'
but you sure know where i stand
hate me if you want to
love me if you can
i stand by my right to speak freely
but i worry 'bout what kids learn from tv
and before all the debating turns to words and hate
something we should just agree to disagree
i believe that jesus
looks down here and sees us
if you ask him he would say
i'm a man of my convictions
call me wrong
call me right
but i bring my better angels to every fight
you may not like where i'm goin'
but you sure know where i stand
hate me if you want to
love me if you can
i'm a man of my convictions
call me wrong
call me right
but i bring my better angels to every fight
you may not like where i'm goin'
but you sure know where i stand
hate me if you want to
love me if you can 


kevin brandt
my baby knows me better than i do
funny how a woman has that over a man
i can do anything with her here beside me
leaning on her is where i make my stand
where would we be without the love of a woman
standing behind her man even when he's wrong
the true pure undying love of a woman
makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
my daddy was a wild one when he was younger
everybody told my mama he'd be hard to tame
full of himself he said 'sir' to nobody
but you oughta see him come a runnin' when mama calls his name
where would we be without the love of a woman
standing behind her man even when he's wrong
the true pure undying love of a woman
makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
oh yeah
a man goes crazy trying to catch his feelings
too much pride or maybe the words come out wrong
but that's okay 'cause he's still her hero
steady as a rock her love keeps rolling along
where would we be without the love of a woman
standing behind her man even when he's wrong
the true pure undying love of a woman
makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone 

we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes
and the flashback starts
i'm standing there
on a balcony in summer air
i see the lights
see the party the ballgowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say hello
little did i know
that you were romeo you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said stay away from juliet
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you please don't go and i said
romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story baby just say yes
so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while
'cause you were romeo i was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said stay away from juliet
but you were everything to me
i was begging you please don't go and i said
romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story baby just say yes
romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult but it's so real
don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess
it's a love story baby just say yes
oh oh
i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said
romeo save me i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you but you never come
is this in my head i don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
marry me juliet you'll never have to be alone
i love you and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
it's a love story baby just say yes
oh oh
oh oh oh
'cause we were both young when i first saw you 
love sweet love
love sweet love
you let the sun light up my life
we'll lay a blanket on the ground
down by the river side
we'll smell the flowers
savor the wine
get lost in each others arms
one kiss at a time
there's no telling what were gonna do
when the only thing between me and you
is love sweet love intoxicating
honey to a bee sugar for you baby
can never get enough to satisfy the graving
for love love love 
love sweet love
there's a soundof you and me
getting carried away together
on a sunny breeze

love sweet love intoxicating
honey to a bee sugar for you baby

in a bar in toledo across from the depot
on a bar stool she took off her ring
i thought i'd get closer so i walked on over
i sat down and asked her name
when the drinks finally hit her she said i'm no quitter
but i finally quit livin' on dreams
i'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
i'm after whatever the other life brings
in the mirror i saw him and i closely watched him
i thought how he looked out of place
he came to the woman who sat there beside me
had a strange look on his face
the big hands were calloused he looked like a mountain
for a minute i thought i was dead
but he started shaking his big heart was breaking
he turned to the woman and said
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille
with four hungry children and a crop in the field
i've had some bad times lived through some sad times
but this time your hurting won't heal
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille
after he left us i ordered more whisky
i thought how she'd made him look small
from the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
we walked without talking at all
she was a beauty but when she came to me
she must have thought i'd lost my mind
i couldn't hold her 'cos the words that he told her
kept coming back time after time
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille

mama knows the highway by the songs
when she hears a good one she always sings along
she don't ever worry 'bout what's gone
she says good country music will never steer you wrong
she talks to the truckers with the lights
maybe just a little bit more on saturday nights
she knows a good road to paradise
and that's just enough to keep the highway bright
yeahmama knows the highway now by heart
she can see the rain before it starts
looking clear through a windshield full of stars
mama knows the highway now by heart
she can tell wyoming by the wind
she can tell another trucker by the rig that he's in
she knows how to watch the river bends
she knows where the real south begins
well mama knows the highway now by heart
she can see the rain before it starts
looking clear through a windshield full of stars
mama knows the highway now by heart
she can gauge a cafe just by looking at the sign
little old places always share the grand design
mama knows the highway now by heart
she can see the rain before it starts
looking clear through a windshield full of stars
mama knows the highway now by heart
mama knows the highway now by heart
mama knows the highway yeah yeah yeah

it's a neverending circus ride
the faint of heart need not apply
mi vida loca over and over
destiny turns on a dime
i go where the wind blows
you can't tame a wild rose
welcome to my crazy life
sweetheart before this night is through
i could fall in love with you
come dancing on the edge with me
let my passion set you free

here in the firelight i see your tattoo
mi vido loco so you're crazy too

we'll go where the wind blows
and i'll be your wild rose
welcome to my crazy life 




ain't it funny how life feels measured in time
ain't if funny how fate never leaves it to late i heard a heavenly song i started singing along still i can't beleive you sent her to me 
she feel from the sky right into my life through a hole in the clouds all her friends were looking down i found her crying in the rain i helped her mend her wings when she never flew back lord i knew for a fact that you were missing an angel 
is she here to save us all or just to catch me when i fall is she part of your plan to make me a better man every night i say a pray in the morning she'll be there and if i die before i wake chalk it up to give or take

when she never flew back lord i knew for a fact you were missing an angel 
oh yeah oh yeah missing an angel 
yeah
well it's a long way from starmississippi
to the big stage i'm singing on tonight
and sometimes the butterflies still get me
when i'm in the spotlight
and some people seem to think that i've changed
that i'm different than i was back then
but in my soul i know that i'm the same way
that i've really always been

'cause a mississippi girl don't change her ways
just 'cause everybody knows her name
ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
i still like wearing my old ball cap
ride my kids around piggy back
they might know me all around the world
but y'all i'm still a mississippi girl
whoo
well i spent a few weeks in california
they put my face on the big movie screen
but that don't mean i've forgotten where i came from
that's just me chasing dreams

whoo 
'cause a mississippi girl don't change her ways
just 'cause everybody knows her name
ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
still like wearing my old ball cap
ride my kids around piggy back
they might know me all around this world 
thats alright
but y'all i'm still a mississippi girl
mississippi girl 
ohoh 
mississippi girl
 
yeah yeah oh
oh oh oh oh oh 
mississippi girl 
na na na na na na
na na na na na nafade 

annie tatesam tatedave berg
i was coming to the end of a long long walk
when a man crawled out of a cardboard box
under the e street bridge
followed me on to it
i went out halfway across
with that homeless shadow tagging along
so i dug for some change
wouldn't need it anyway
he took it lookin' just a bit ashamed
he said you know i haven't always been this way
i've had my moments days in the sun
moments i was second to none
moments when i knew i did what i thought i couldn't do
like that plane ride coming home from the war
that summer my son was born
and memories like a coat so warm
a cold wind can't get through
lookin' at me now you might not know it
but i've had my moments
i stood there tryin' to find my nerve
wondering if a single soul on earth
would care at all
miss me when i'm gone
that old man just kept hanging around
lookin' at me lookin' down
i think he recognized
that look in my eyes
standing with him there i felt ashamed
i said you know i haven't always been this way
i've had my moments days in the sun
moments i was second to none
moments when i knew i did what i thought i couldn't do
like the day i walked away from the wine
for a woman who became my wife
and a love that when it was right
could always see me through
lookin' at me now you might not know it
but i've had my moments
i know somewhere 'round a trashcan fire tonight
that old man tells his story one more time
he says
i've had my moments days in the sun
moments i was second to none
moments when i knew i did what i thought i couldn't do
like that cool night on the e street bridge
when a young man almost ended it
i was right there wasn't scared a bit
and i helped to pull him through
lookin' at me now you might not know it
oh lookin' at me now you might not know it
but i've had my moments
i've had my moments
i've had my moments
i've had my moments 


people say she's only in my head 
it's gonna take time but i'll forget 
they say i need to get on with my life 
what they don't realize 
is when you're dialing six numbers just to hang up the phone 
driving cross town just to see if she's home 
waking a friend in the dead of night 
just to hear him say it's gonna be all right 
when you're finding things to do not to fall asleep 
cause you know she'll be there in your dreams 
that's when she's 
more than a memory 
took a match to everything she ever wrote 
watched her words go up in smoke 
tore all her pictures off the wall 
but that ain't helping me at all 
cause when you're talking out loud but nobody's there 
you look like hell and you just don't care 
drinking more than you ever drank 
sinking down lower than you ever sank 
when you find yourself falling down upon your knees 
praying to god begging him please 
that's when she's 
more than a memory 
she's more 
she's more 
when you're dialing her number just to hang up the phone 
driving cross town just to see if she's home 
waking a friend in the dead of night 
just to hear him say it's gonna be all right 
when you're finding things to do not to fall asleep 
cause you know she's waiting in your dreams
that's when she's 
more than a memory 
people say she's only in my head
it's gonna take time but i'll forget 
hey
did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world
and if you did was she crying crying
hey

that walked out on me

i woke up this morning 
realized what i had done
i stood alone in the cold gray dawn
i knew i'd lost my morning sun
i lost my head and i said some things
now comes the heartaches that morning brings
i know i'm wrong and i couldn't see
i let my world slip away from me
so hey
did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world
and if you did was she crying crying

words and music by randy owen

well one of these days i'm gonna climb that mountain

oh play me some mountain music 
like grandma and grandpa used to play

oh play me some mountain music 
like grandma and grandpa used to play
then i'll float on down the river 
to a cajun hideaway
swim across the river just to prove that i'm a man
spend the day bein' lazy just bein' nature's friend
climb a long tall hick'ry bend it over skinnin' cats
playin' baseball with chert rocks usin' sawmill slabs for bats
bridge
play some backhome comeon music 
that comes from the heart
play something with lots of feelin' 
'cause that's where music has to start
oh play me some mountain music 
like grandma and grandpa used to play

to a cajun hideaway hey hey

our guardian star lost all its glow

hurtin' me through and through

i knew a man bojangles and he'd dance for you 
in worn out shoes 
silver hair and ragged shirt and baggy pants
the old soft shoe 
he jumped so high he jumped so high 
and then he'd lightly touch down 
i met him in a cell in new orleans i was 
down and out 
he looked to me to be the eyes of age 
as the smoke ran out 
he talked of life he talked of life 
he laughed clicked his heels and stepped 
he said his name bojangles and he danced a lick 
across the cell 
he grabbed his pants and favorite stance oh he jumped so high 
and then he clicked his heels 
he let go a laugh he let go a laugh 
shook back his clothes all around 
mr bojangles
mr bojangles 
mr bojangles 
dance 
he danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs 
throughout the south 
he spoke through tears of fifteen years how his dog and him 
traveled about 
the dog up and died he up and died 
after twenty years he still grieves 
he said i dance now at every chance in honky tonks 
for drinks and tips 
but most the time i spend behind these county bars
'cause i drinks a bit
he shook his head and as he shook his head 
i heard someone ask him please please 
mr bojangles 
mr bojangles 
mr bojangles 
dance 
this ol' highway's gettin' longer
seems there ain't no end in sight
to sleep would be best but i just can't afford to rest
i've got to ride in denver tomorrow night
i called the house but no one answered
for the last two weeks no one's been home
i guess she's through with me to tell the truth i just can't see
what's kept the woman holdin' on this long

and the white line's gettin' longer and the saddle's gettin' cold
i'm much too young to feel this damn old
all my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
i'm much too young to feel this damn old
the competition's gettin' younger
tougher broncs you know i can't recall
the worn out tape of chris ledoux lonely women and bad booze
seem to be the only friends i've left at all

and the white line's gettin' longer and the saddle's gettin' cold
i'm much too young to feel this damn old
all my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
i'm much too young to feel this damn old
lord i'm much too young to feel this damn old 
i've got some big news
the bank finally came through
and i'm holdin the keys to a brand new chevrolet
have you been outside it sure is a nice night
how about a little test drive
down by the lake
there's a place i know about where the dirt road runs out
and we can try out the fourwheel drive
come on now what do you say
girl i can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

'cause it's a good night
to be out there soakin' up the moonlight
stake out a little piece of shore line
i've got the perfect place in mind
it's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
you got to get a little mud on the tires
  
moonlight on a duck blind
catfish on a trot line
sun sets about nine this time of year
we can throw a blanket down
crickets singin' in the background
and more stars that you can count on a night this clear
i tell you what we need to do
is grab a sleepin' bag or two
and build us a little campfire
and then with a little luck we might just get stuck
let's get a little mud on the tires

'cause it's a good night
to be out there soakin' up the moonlight
stake out a little piece of shore line
i've got the perfect place in mind
it's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
you got to get a little mud on the tires
and then with a little luck we might just get stuck
let's get a little mud on the tires 
a woman is mystery
a man just can't understand
sometimes all it takes to please her
is the touch of your hand
and other times you gotta take it slow
and hold her all night long
heaven knows there's so many ways
a man can go wrong

must be doin' something right
i just heard you sigh
you leaned into my kiss
and closed those deep blue need you eyes
don't know what i did
to earn a love like this but baby i
must be doin' something right
anywhere you wanna go 
baby show me the way
i'm open to suggestions
mmm whatever you say
tonight's about giving you
what you want whatever it takes
girl i hope i'm on the right road
and judging by the smile on your face

ah baby
mmm
i don't know what i did
to earn a love like this but baby i
must be doin' something right
must be doin' something right 
well i must've had a ball last night
i can't recall what even started our fight
i must've drank away my blues
'cause i don't remember losin' you
well i must've done the town up right
'cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
there ain't no way of knowin'
but all the signs are showin'
i must've had a ball last night
well i woke up this mornin'
underneath my bed
and someone's in the kitchen sink
with cowboy boots on and nothin' else at all
except my hat turned backway on her head
well i must've had a ball last night
i can't recall what even started out fight
well i must've drank away my blues
'cause i don't remember losing you
well i must've done the town up right
'cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
there ain't no way of knowin'
but all the signs are showin'
i must've had a ball last night
well my picture's on the table
somebody tore it right in two
well who'd do such a crazy thing
someone took your suitcase and your little car
and i hate it 'cause the tires are new
yeah i must've had a ball last night
i can't recall what even started out fight
i must've drank away my blues
'cause i don't remember losing you
well i must've done the town up right
'cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
there ain't no way of knowin'
but all the signs are showin'
i must've had a ball last night
well i must've done the town up right
'cause this morning my hats just a little too tight
there ain't no way of knowing
but all the signs are showing
i must've had a ball last night
well there ain't way knowin'
but all the signs are showin'
i must've had a ball last night 



i grew up adreamin' of bein' a cowboy
and lovin' the cowboy ways
pursuin' the life of my highridin' heroes
i burned up my childhood days
i learned of all the rules of the modernday drifter
don't you hold on to nothin' too long
just take what you need from the ladies then leave them
with the words of a sad country song 
my heroes have always been cowboys
and they still are it seems
sadly in search of but one step in back of
themselves and their slowmovin' dreams
cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
from being alone too long
you could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
knowin' well that your best days are gone
pickin' up hookers instead of my pen
i let the words of my years fade away
old wornout saddles and 'old wornout memories
with no one and no place to stay
my heroes have always been cowboys
and they still are it seems
sadly in search of but one step in back of
themselves and their slowmovin' dreams
sadly in search of but one step in back of
themselves and their slowmovin' dreams 
when i saw you buying cosmo and a hot rod magazine
i said to myself 'now there's a girl for me'
and when i asked you to go for a ride
you stole my heart when you said if i can drive
i said how 'bout some music
you said you got any merle
that's when i knew you were my kind of girl
and when we started talking i could not believe my ears
you said you were a braves fan even through the rotten years
you quoted william parker and martin luther king
you said your favorite movie star would always be james dean 
and when we went to dinner you wore blue jeans with your pearls
that's when i knew you were my kind of girl
you march to the beat of a different drum
the funny thing is that i hear the same one
we both like to color outside of the lines
we're peas in a pod girl we're two of a kind
you march to the beat of a different drum
the funny thing is that i hear the same one
we both like to color outside of the lines
we're peas in a pod girl we're two of a kind
i said i think i love you
you said what's not to love
i thought about a kiss but i wasn't quick enough
i guess while i was thinking you were reading my mind
'cause you wrapped your arms around me
and you pressed your lips to mine
you set my head spinning just like a tiltawhirl
that's when i knew you were my kind of girl
you set my head aspinnin' just like a tiltawhirl
that's when i knew you were my kind of girl 


verse 1 
gotta hold on easy as i let you go 
gonna tell you how much i love you though you think you already know 
i remember i thought you looked like an angel wrapped in pink so soft and warm 
you've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born
 
beautiful baby from the outside in 
chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again 
go on take on this whole world 
but to me you know you'll always be my little girl 
verse 2 
when you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone 
now look at you i've turned around and you've almost grown 
sometimes you're asleep i whisper i love you in the moonlight at your door 
as i walk away i hear you say daddy love you more 

verse 3 
someday some boy will come and ask me for your hand 
but i won't say yes to him unless i know he's the half
that makes you whole he has a poet's soul and the heart of a man's man 
i know he'll say that he's in love 
but between you and me he won't be good enough
 
my maria
don't you know i've come a long long way
i been longin' to see her
when she's around she takes my blues away
sweet maria 
the sunlight surely hurts my eyes
i'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies
maria oh maria i love you girl oh my maria
maria oh maria i love you girl maria i love you
i love you
my maria 
there were some blue and sorrow times
just my thoughts about you bring back my piece of mind
gypsy lady
you're a miracle work for me
you set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea
she is the sunlight when the skies are grey
she treats me so right lady take me away
my maria oh maria i love you girl oh my maria
maria oh maria i love you girl maria i love you
i love you
my maria oh maria i love you girl oh my maria
maria oh maria i love you girl maria i love you
i love you
my maria oh maria i love you girl oh my maria
maria oh maria i love you girl maria i love you
i love you
my maria oh maria i love you girl oh my maria
maria oh maria i love you girl maria i love you
i love you
my maria oh maria i love you girl oh my maria
maria oh maria i love you girl maria i love you
i love you
fade out 
my old friend i recall 
the times we had hanging on my wall 
i wouldn't trade them for gold 
cause they laugh and they cry me 
somehow sanctify me 
they're woven in the stories i have told 
and tell again 
my old friend i apologize 
for the years that have passed 
since the last time you and i 
dusted off those memories 
but the running and the races 
the people and the places 
there's always somewhere else i had to be 
time gets thin my old friend 
don't know why don't know why 
don't know why don't know why 
my old friend this song's for you 
cause a few simple verses 
was the least that i could do 
to tell the world that you were here 
cause the love and the laughter 
will live on long after 
all of the sadness and the tears 
we'll meet again my old friend 
goodbye goodbye 
goodbye goodbye 
my old friend my old friend 
goodbye goodbye 
the wages of an unskilled
working man never paid enough
from time to time a nickel on a race
keeps him from giving up
a blue collared man in seattle
never lives on white collared street
but there was food on the table
for my washington woman and me
the work slowed down and the one day
the foreman laid me off
that night in a tavern down on my last dime
i met a girl from arkansas
her daddy was a banker in little rock
she had a mansion on white collared street
the next morning my washington woman
woke up without me
from city to city and state to state
i get her in shame
my washington woman had six months left
before out child would bring her pain
that arkansas woman hurt me
as we crossed the arkansas line
but the arms of seattle
are the arms that kept huggin' mine
for year i have basked in expensive wines
taste champagne every day
i gave up all the things i loved
for all these things i hate
i locked up all of her forgiveness
the day i set myself free
and the heart of my washington woman
stopped beating for me
my washington woman sends me a letter
every once in a while
inside a folded wordless page
is a picture of my child
all but words the room grows cold
with a feeling of jealousy
and there's a silence between
my arkansas woman and me 
i hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow
and each road leads you where you want to go
and if you're faced with a choice and you have to choose
i hope you choose the one that means the most to you
and if one door opens to another door closed
i hope you keep on walkin' till you find the window
if it's cold outside show the world the warmth of your smile
but more than anything more than anything
my wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
your dreams stay big and your worries stay small
you never need to carry more than you can hold
and while you're out there getting where you're getting to
i hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things too
yeah this is my wish
i hope you never look back but ya never forget
all the ones who love you in the place you left
i hope you always forgive and you never regret
and you help somebody every chance you get
oh you find god's grace in every mistake
and you always give more than you take
but more than anything yeah and more than anything
my wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
your dreams stay big and your worries stay small
you never need to carry more than you can hold
and while you're out there getting where you're getting to
i hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things too
yeah this is my wish
this is my wish
i hope you know somebody loves you my wish for you
may all your dreams stay big my wish for you 
this concrete road used to just be dirt
we'd drive out here after work
every friday night when i was eighteen
this parking lot used to be a field
i parked here in my oldsmobile
long before the sonic and the walgreens
not no more

in the blink of an eye
my oh my

turning around before you know it
up and gone
oh my oh my oh my

no cell phones and water was free
daddy paid and i never had to worry

i don't want no trouble man just came to sing my songs
well i don't want no trouble man but trouble's what i found
guess i'm hellbent and nashville bound 
somewhere in kentucky stopped for one or two

just rollin' smokes and killin' time sittin' in this county jail 
now the jailer's got a daughter and she's smilin' back at me

when the sun goes down
on my side of town
that lonesome feeling
comes to my door
the whole world turns blue
there's a rundown bar
cross the railroad tracks
i've got a table for two
way in the back
where i sit alone
and think of losing you
i spend most every night
beneath the light
of a neon moon
if you lose your one and only
there's always room here for the lonely
to watch your broken dreams
dance in and out of the beams
of a neon moon
i think of two young lovers
running wild and free
i close my eyes
and sometimes see
you in the shadows
of this smokefilled room
no telling how many tears
i've sat here and cried
or how many lies
that i've lied
telling my poor heart
she'll come back someday
oh but i'll be alright
as long as there's light
from a neon moon
if you lose your one and only
there's always room here for the lonely
to watch your broken dreams
dance in and out of the beams
of a neon moon
the jukebox plays on
drink by drink
and the words of every sad song
seem to say what i think
and this hurt inside of me
ain't never gonna end
oh but i'll be alright
as long as there's light
from a neon moon
if you lose your one and only
there's always room here for the lonely
to watch your broken dreams
dance in and out of the beams
of a neon moon
to watch your broken dreams
dance in and out of the beams
of a neon moon
to watch your broken dreams
dance in and out of the beams
of a neon moon 
you're the light that lights my way on the rainy nights
you're the road that's headed home when it's bitter outside
you're the hand that i hold when i'm scared of the dark

there'll never ever be another you
i could search my whole life through
it's no use all roads lead me to you
there'll never be anotheryou
you're the first warm breath of spring when the winter ends
you're my secret hiding place when the world is closing in
you're the rain pouring down when the well runs dry

ohh no
never be another
you're the rain falling down when the well runs dry
never be another be another you
never be anotherohh no

never be another you
ohh no
never be another 
couldn't wait to turn 16 and drive all the boy's around
foot on the gas and hands on the wheel was all i could think about
a little rust in the bed of that truck and a four speed on the floor
fivehundred dollars it was mine all mine and i never wanted nothin' more
i took katie down by the river with a six dollar bottle of wine
just a fool tryin' to play it cool hopin' she'd let me cross the line
i was praying that she couldn't tell i hadn't been that far before
the first time's a one time feelin' and i never wanted nothin' more
no i never wanted nothin' more
well i'm what i am and i'm what i'm not
i'm sure happy with what i've got
i live to love and laugh a lot
and that's all i need
my buddies all tried to change my mind
but i told them that i'd thought it through
katie laughed and my mama cried when they heard me say i do
a little ring is a little thing but its all i could afford
now she's mine all mine till the day i die and i never wanted nothin' more
well i'm what i am and i'm what i'm not
i'm sure happy with what i've got
i live to love and laugh a lot
and that's all i need
one sunday i listened to the preacher and i knew he was preaching to me
i couldn't help it i walked up front and i got down on my knees
right then and there i swear i changed when i found the lord
glory hallelujah good god almighty i never wanted nothin' more
well i'm what i am and i'm what i'm not
i'm sure happy with what i've got
i live to love and laugh a lot
and that's all i need
never wanted nothin' more
and i never wanted nothin' more 


like birds on a high line
they line up at night time at the bar
they all once were lovebirds
now bluebirds are all that they are
they landed in hell
the minute they fell from love's sky
and now they hope in the wine
that they'll find a new way to fly

a new way to fly
far away from goodbye
above the clouds and the rain
the memories and the pain
and the tears that they cry
now the lesson's been learned
they've all crashed and burned
but they can leave it behind
if they could just find
a new way to fly
by the end of the night
they'll be high as a kite once again
and they don't seem to mind all the time
or the money they spend
it's a high price to pay
to just find a way to get by
but it's worth every dime
if they find a new way to fly

they'll leave it behind
as soon as they find
a new way to fly 
ridin' down the road in my pickup truck
ya' better be ready 'cause i'm pickin' you up
with a full moon a shinin' and a little bit a' luck
we'll run out outta gas and maybe get stuck
we could get lost baby i don't care
i ain't worried as long as you're there
there ain't no place that i'd rather be
next to you sittin' next to me
there ain't no place that i'd rather be
next to you next to me
barbecue chicken in aluminum foil
just enough money for my gas and oil
who needs your shrimp and your caviar
i'd sooner have you just the way you are
rich people got their money to hold
mansion on the hill and diamonds and gold 
it can't compare as far as i can see
next to you sittin' next to me
there ain't no place that i'd rather be
next to you next to me
radio playin' our favorite song
i'll change the station if the news comes on
when the signal ain't comin' in too strong
we'll make our own music honey all night long
if the good lord's willin' when we're old and gray
the kids are grown up and moved away
we'll be rockin' there side by side
with barbeque chicken and the tv guide
well there ain't no place that i'd rather be
next to sittin' next to me
no there ain't no place that i'd rather be
next to you next to me
there ain't no place that i'd rather be
next to you sittin' next to me
next to you next to me
next to you next to me
next to you next to me
next to you next to me 
won't you please turn up the lights
i can't hardly see
thank you kindly but that don't help
maybe it's just me
it seems i've had this problem since
my baby packed up to leave
you see she used to be my sunshine
now we're far apart
night is fallin' in my heart
oh the light is slowly fading
skies are growing dark
night is fallin' in my heart
could you pull those curtains back
and let the morning in
what's that you say oh is that a fact
well it still seems mighty dim
i guess i'll just have to live this way
unless my baby come back again
you see she used to be my sunshine
now we're far apart
night is fallin' in my heart
oh the light is slowly fading
skies are growing dark
night is fallin' in my heart
and as the last ray of love
slowly disappears
alone in this endless night
i just see one thing clear
you see she used to be my sunshine
now we're far apart
night is fallin' in my heart
oh the light is slowly fading
skies are growing dark
night is fallin' in my heart 
he was on his way home from candletop 
been two weeks gone and he'd thought he'd stop 
at web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
andy warlord said hello
he said how what's doin' 
wo said sit down i got some bad news and it's gonna hurt
he said i'm your best friend and you know that's right 
but your young bride ain't home tonight
since you been gone she's been seeing that amos boy seth
now he got mad and he saw red
andy said boy don't you lose your head 
'cos to tell you the truth i've been with her myself
that's the night that the lights went out in georgia
that's the night that they hung an innocent man
well don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
'cos the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands
well andy got scared and left the bar
walkin' on home 'cos he didn't live far 
you see andy didn't have many friends 
and he just lost him one
brother thought his wife musta left town 
so he went home and finally found 
the only thing papa had left him and that was a gun 
he went off to andy's house 
slippin' through the back woods quiet as a mouse 
came upon some tracks too small for andy to make
he looked through the screen at the back porch door 
and he saw andy lyin on the floor
in a puddle of blood and he started to shake
georgia patrol was making their rounds 
so he fired a shot just to flag them down 
a bigbellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said why'd you do it
judge said guilty on a makebelieve trial 
slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile 
and said supper's waitin' at home and i gotta get to it
that's the night that the lights went out in georgia
that's the night that they hung an innocent man
well don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
'cos the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands
well they hung my brother before i could say 
the tracks he saw while on his way 
to andy's house and back that night were mine
and his cheatin' wife had never left town 
that's one body that'll never be found
you see little sister don't miss when she aims her gun
that's the night that the lights went out in georgia
that's the night that they hung an innocent man
well don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
'cos the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands
that's the night that the lights went out in georgia
that's the night that they hung an innocent man
well don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
'cos the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands 
i've been a rock and i've got my fences
i never let them down
when it comes to love i keep my senses
i don't get kicked around
i shivered once you broke into my soul
the damage is done now
i'm outta control
how did you get to me
no one else on earth
could ever hurt me
break my heart the way you do
no one else on earth
was ever worth it
no one could love me like
no one could love me like you
you can make me want you
any time you want to
you're burning me alive
i can't deny you
even when i catch you
weaving a weak alibi
'cause when the night falls
you make me forget
your love is killing me
and it ain't over yet
how did you get to me
no one else on earth
could ever hurt me
break my heart the way you do
no one else on earth
was ever worth it
no one could love me like
no one could love me like you
i shivered once you broke into my soul
the damage is done now
i'm outta control
how did you get to me
no one else on earth
could ever hurt me
break my heart the way you do
no one else on earth
was ever worth it
no one could love me like
no one could love me like you
no one else on earth
could ever hurt me
break my heart the way you do
no one else on earth
was ever worth it
no one could love me like
no one could love me like you
no one else on earth
was ever worth it
no one could love me like
no one like you
no one like you 
am i dreamin'
or stupid
i think i've been hit by cupid
but no one needs to know right now
i met a tall dark
and handsome man
and i've been busy makin' big plans
but no one needs to know right now
i got my heart set
my feet wet
but he don't even know yet
but no one needs to know right now
i'll tell him someday
some way and somehow
but i'm gonna keep it a secret for now
i want bells to ring
choir to sing
the white dress the guests the cake the car the whole darn thing
but no one needs to know right now
i'll tell him someday
some way and somehow
but i'm gonna keep it a secret for now
we'll have a little girl
a little boy
a little benji we call leroy
but no one needs to know right now
and i'm not lonely
anymore at night
and he don't know that only
he can make it right
and i'm not lonely
anymore at night
and he don't know that only
he can make it right
i'm not dreamin'
or stupid
but boy have i been hit by cupid
but no one needs to know right now
no one no one
no one needs to know right now
no one no one
no one needs to know
right now 
there's no time to kill between the cradle and the grave
father time still takes a toll on every minute that you save
legal tenders never gonna change the number of your days
the highest cost of livin is dying that's one everybody pays
so have it spent before you get the bill there's no time to kill
if we'd known ten years ago today would be ten years from now
would we spend tomorrows yesterdays and make it last somehow
or lead the cheers in someone else's game and never learn to play
and see the rules of thumb are all the same that measure every day
the grass is green on both sides of the hill there's no time to kill
no time to kill even i've said it and probably always will
but i can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
no time to kill but time to change the kind of hurry i've been in
and quit this work and worry looking back at where i've been
if you don't look ahead nobody will there's no time to kill
if we had an hour glass to watch each one go by
or a bell to mark each one to pass we'd see just how they fly
would we escalate the value to be worth its weight in gold
or would we never know the fortunes that we had til we grow old
and do we just keep killin time until there's no time to kill
no time to kill even i've said it and probably always will
but i can look ahead and see that time ain't standin still
no time to kill but time to change the kind of hurry i've been in
and quit this work and worry lookin back at where i've been
if you don't look ahead nobody will there's no time to kill
no time to kill even i've said it and probably always will
but i can look ahead and see that time ain't standin still
no time to kill but time to change the kind of hurry i've been in
and quit this work and worry lookin back at where i've been
if you don't look ahead nobody will there's no time to kill
no time to kill
no time to kill 
don't waste your time looking over your shoulder
those loves from the past ain't getting no closer
when i look in my future you're all i can see
don't go loving on nobody but me

nobody but me gonna love you like you ought to be loved on
nobody but me gonna cry if you up and leave
you can do what you want to but i'm asking pretty please honey don't go loving on nobody but me
i took my time to tell you how i feel
just because i took so long don't mean that it isn't real
i ain't got no diamond but i'm down on my knees
don't go loving on nobody but me

nobody but me gonna love you like you ought to be loved on
nobody but me gonna cry if you up and leave
you can do what you want to but i'm asking pretty please honey don't go loving on nobody but me

nobody but me gonna love you like you ought to be loved on
nobody but me gonna cry if you up and leave
you can do what you want to but i'm asking pretty please honey don't go loving on nobody but me
don't go loving on nobody but me 
she's a fallen angel
she's just flesh and bone
she's the rock of ages
she‚s a rollin‚ stone

she's nobody's girl
she walks this road alone nobody's girl
she calls her soul her own nobody's girl
she knows she's on her own in this world
she's nobody's girl
she's some kind of devil
she's some kind of saint
and if her hands are dirty
well her spirit ain't

now if the world don't claim you
it don't own you too
she don't belong to me no no
she don't belong to you
 twice 
move slowly to my dresser drawers 
put my blue jeans on 
find my cowboy boots 
my button down 
strap my timepiece on my arm 
grab my billfold my pocket change 
just a mindless old routine 
then it's out the door and down the street 
but it's not really me i still comb my hair the same 
still like the same cologne and i still drive that pickup truck 
that the same old bank still owns 
but since you left everybody says i'm not the guy they've known 
the lights are on but nobody's home 
cup of coffee in the morning 
just food for the brain 
but i've been numb since our last goodbye 
i haven't felt a thing but now there's pains in my head 
and pains in my chest
and i think i'm losing my hair i'm a half a man with half a mind 
to think you didn't care 
 
sittin' in a restaraunt and she walked by
i seem to recall that certain look in your eye
i said who's that you said with a smile
oh it's nobody aww nobody
maybe that explains the last two weeks
you call me up dead on your feet
working late again i ask who with
you said nobody aww nobody
well your nobody called today
she hung up when i asked her name
well i wonder does she think she's being clever clever
you say nobody's after you
the fact is what you say is true
but i can love you like nobody can even better
late last night we went for a drive
you were miles away
i ask who's on your mind
you said nobody nobody why do you ask
oh her again i couldve told you that
we came back home got ready for bed
i said to myself i've got one shot left
your still mine
and i won't stand in line behind nobody aww nobody
well your nobody called today
she hung up when i asked her name
well i wonder does she think shes being clever clever
you say nobody's after you
the fact is what you say is true
but i can love you like nobody can even better
repeat 

way up north to alaska way up north to alaska
north to alaska go north the rush is on
north to alaska go north the rush is on
big sam left seattle in the year of '92
with george pratt his partner and brother billy too
they crossed the yukon river and found a bonanza gold
below that old white mountain just a little southeast of nome
sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below
he talked to his team of huskies as they mushed on through the snow
with the northern lights a runnin' wild in the land of the midnight sun
yes sam mccord was a mighty man in the year of nineteenone
where the river is winding big nuggets they're finding
north to alaska go north the rush is on

george turned to sam with his gold in his hand
said 'sam you're a lookin' at a lonely lonely man
i'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
for one small band of golden place on sweet little jenny's hand
'cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
remember sam a true love is so hard to find
i'd build for my jenny a honeymoon home
below that old white mountain just a little southeast of nome'
where the river is windin' big nuggets they're findin'
north to alaska we've gone north the rush is on
north to alaska we've gone north the rush is on
 

got a picture of you i carry in my heart
close my eyes to see it when the world gets dark
got a memory of you i carry in my soul
i wrap it close around me when the nights get cold
if you asked me how i'm doin' i'd say just fine
but the truth is baby if you could read my mind
not a day goes by that i don't think of you
after all this time you're still with me it's true
somehow you remain locked so deep inside
baby baby oh baby not a day goes by
i still wait for the phone in the middle of the night
thinkin' you might call me if your dreams don't turn out right
and it still amazes me that i lie here in the dark
wishin' you were next to me with your head against my heart
if you asked me how i'm doing i'd say just fine
but the truth is baby if you could read my mind
not a day goes by that i don't think of you
after all this time you're still with me it's true
somehow you remain locked so deep inside
baby baby oh baby not a day goes by
minutes turn to hours and the hours to days
seems it's been forever that i've felt this way
not a day goes by that i don't think of you
after all this time you're still with me it's true
oh somehow you remain locked so deep inside
baby baby oh baby not a day goes by
that i don't think of you 
forgive sounds good
forget i'm not sure i could
they say time heals everything
but i'm still waiting
i'm through with doubt
there's nothing left for me to figure out
i've paid a price
and i'll keep paying
i'm not ready to make nice
i'm not ready to back down
i'm still mad as hell and
i don't have time to go round and round and round
it's too late to make it right
i probably wouldn't if i could
'cause i'm mad as hell
can't bring myself to do what it is you think i should
i know you said
can't you just get over it
it turned my whole world around
and i kind of like it
i made my bed and i sleep like a baby
with no regrets and i don't mind sayin'
it's a sad sad story when a mother will teach her
daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
and how in the world can the words that i said
send somebody so over the edge
that they'd write me a letter
sayin' that i better 
shut up and sing or my life will be over
i'm not ready to make nice
i'm not ready to back down
i'm still mad as hell and
i don't have time to go round and round and round
it's too late to make it right
i probably wouldn't if i could
'cause i'm mad as hell
can't bring myself to do what it is you think i should
i'm not ready to make nice
i'm not ready to back down
i'm still mad as hell and
i don't have time to go round and round and round
it's too late to make it right
i probably wouldn't if i could
'cause i'm mad as hell
can't bring myself to do what it is you think i should
what it is you think i should
forgive sounds good
forget i'm not sure i could
they say time heals everything
but i'm still waiting 
stopped to have a few at five now you're crossing that center line for the third time
second time like this this week had a friend ask you for your keys
you said ëno i'm fine'
you sure do act like you don't got a thing to lose
but every car you pass might be the one's you take with you

you'd give your last breath to your wife
take a bullet for your kids
lay your life down for your country for your jesus for your friends
there's a whole lot of things you say you're living for
you've got to fight it somehow stop and turn around
ëcause this ain't nothin' to die for
so what's the harm in a little fun
ëcause you're off to work before the sun everyday
and the inbox outbox locks you in and the money you make ain't worth the time you spend to make your pay
the doctor says ëman your numbers they don't lie'
the graveyard's full of folks that didn't have time to die

straight through that guardrail up into that white light
you hear a sweet voice saying just this side of the other side
just this side of the other side

ain't nothin' to die for
nothin' to die for
ain't nothin' to die for 

i've got a long list of real good reasons
for all the things i've done
i've got a picture in the back of my mind 
of what i've lost and what i've won
i've survived every situation 
knowing when to freeze and when to run
and regret is just a memory written on my brow 
and there's nothing i can do about it now
i've got a wild and a restless spirit 
i held my price through every deal
i've seen the fire of a woman's scorned 
turn her heart of gold to steal
i've got the song of the voice inside me 
set to the rhythm of the wheel
and i've been dreaming like a child 
since the cradle broke the bow 
and there's nothing i can do about it now
running through the changes 
going through the stages 
coming round the corners in my life
leaving doubt to fate 
staying out too late 
waiting for the moon to say goodniight 
and i could cry for the time i've wasted 
but that's a waste of time and tears 
and i know just what i'd change 
if went back in time somehow
but there's nothing i can do about it now
running through the changes
going through the stages 
coming round the corners in my life
leaving doubt to fate
staying out too late 
waiting for the moon to say goodniight 
and i could cry for the time i've wasted 
but that's a waste of time and tears
and i know just what i'd change 
if went back in time somehow
but there's nothing i can do about it now
i'm forgiving everything that forgiveness will allow 
and there's nothing i can do about it now 
i couldn't change your heart
i couldn't change your mind
so i just have to learn to live with
this empty life you've left behind
you didn't try to hear
you didn't try to see
no you just stared right through the teardrops
like there was nothing left of me
nothing but sorrow
nothing but pain
nothing but memories that whisper your name yeah
nothing but sadness
nothing but fear
nothing but silence heard around here
bridges were burned
lessons were learned
promises made that were broken
tender lies so softly spoken
spoken
you didn't try to hear
you didn't try to see
you just stared right through the teardrops
like there was nothing left of me
nothing but sorrow nothing but sorrow
nothing but pain nothing
nothing but memories that whisper your name
nothing but sadness nothing but sadness
nothing but fear nothing
nothing but silence heard around here
heard around here
nothing but sorrow nothing but sorrow
nothing but pain nothing
nothing but memories that whisper your name
whisper your name
nothing but sadness nothing but sadness
nothing but fear nothing
nothing but silence heard around here
heard around here
i couldn't change your heart 

i always wondered how i'd live without you
if you ever said goodbye
would i just live in dreams about you
with tears in my eyes
would i fall to pieces
when you go
i always wondered how i'd live without you
now i know
i'm doing alright
i'm strong enough to make it on my own
i'm not afraid of the night
i'm learning how to face it alone
i've been good at holding on 
now i'm learning to let go
i always wondered how i'd live without you
now i know
i always wondered what i'd do without you
i found out today
i got up and made a cup of coffee
and time just slipped away
i dressed up and went out on the town 
to places you'd never go
i always wondered what i'd do without you
now i know
i'm doing alright
i'm strong enough to make it on my own
i'm not afraid of the night
i'm learning how to face it alone
i've been good at holding on
now i'm learning to let go
i always wondered how i'd live without you
now i know
i dress up and go out on the town 
to places you'd never go
i always wondered what i'd do without you
now i know
i'm doing alright 
i'm strong enough to make it on my own
i'm not afraid of the night

it was the third of june another sleepy dusty delta day
i was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
and at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
and mama hollered out the back door y'all remember to wipe your feet
and then she said i got some news this mornin' from choctaw ridge
today billie joe macallister jumped off the tallahatchie bridge
and papa said to mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
well billie joe never had a lick of sense pass the biscuits please
there's five more acres in the lower forty i've got to plow
and mama said it was shame about billie joe anyhow
seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on choctaw ridge
and now billie joe macallister's jumped off the tallahatchie bridge
and brother said he recollected when he and tom and billie joe
put a frog down my back at the carroll county picture show
and wasn't i talkin' to him after church last sunday night
i'll have another piece of apple pie you know it don't seem right
i saw him at the sawmill yesterday on choctaw ridge
and now you tell me billie joe's jumped off the tallahatchie bridge
and mama said to me child what's happened to your appetite
i've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite
that nice young preacher brother taylor dropped by today
said he'd be pleased to have dinner on sunday oh by the way
he said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on choctaw ridge
and she and billie joe was throwing somethin' off the tallahatchie bridge
a year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout billie joe
and brother married becky thompson they bought a store in tupelo
there was a virus going 'round papa caught it and he died last spring
and now mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
and me i spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on choctaw ridge
and drop them into the muddy water off the tallahatchie bridge 
we don't smoke marijuana in muskogee
we don't take no trips on lsd
we don't burn no draft cards down on main street
we like livin' right and bein' free
i'm proud to be an okie from muskogee
a place where even squares can have a ball
we still wave old glory down at the courthouse
and white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all
we don't make a party out of lovin'
we like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo
we don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
like the hippies out in san francisco do
and i'm proud to be an okie from muskogee
a place where even squares can have a ball
we still wave old glory down at the courthouse
and white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all
leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
beads and roman sandals won't be seen
football's still the roughest thing on campus
and the kids here still respect the college dean
we still wave old glory down at the courthouse
in muskogee oklahoma usa 




so many times i said it was forever
said our love would always be true
somethin' in my heart always knew
i'd be lying there beside him
on my own on my own on my own
linda davis
so many promises ever should be spoken
now you know what loving him costs
now youre even taking divorce
and you were'nt even married
on my ownonce again
i'm one more time by
myself
reba
no one said it would be easy 
but it once was so easy
well i believe in love now
here i stand
you wonder why
i'm on my own
why did it end this way
on my own 
this wasnt how it was supposed to be
on my own 
i wish that we could do it all again
so many times i know i could have told you
that losing him would cut like a knife
he walked out and there went your life
i dont want to live without him
on my own
this wasn't how it was supposed to end
on my own
i wish that we could do it all again
on my own
i never dreamed i'd spend one night alone by myself
on my own
tricia yearwood you've got to find out where you belong again
on my own
martina mcbride you've got to learn to be strong again
on my own
i never dreamed i'd spend one night alone all by myself
you've got to find out where you belong again
you're heart is saying it's that time again
all and i know you're gonna shine again 
on one hand i count the reasons i could stay with you 
and hold you close to me all night long 
so many lover's games i could play with you 
and on that hand i see no reason why it's wrong 
 
but on the other hand there's a golden band 
to remind of someone who would not understand 
on one hand i could stay and be your loving man 
but the reason i must go is on the other hand 
in your arms i feel the passion i thought had died 
when i looked into your eyes i found myself 
when i first kissed your lips i felt so alive 
i've got to hand it to you girl you're something else 
 
on the road again
just can't wait to get on the road again
the life i love is makin' music with my friends

billy was born in a prairie storm dust turned the whole town black
dad left home a month before and promised he'd be back
he said i can't make a living out of farming dust ain't no other job around here 
then he turned and climbed aboard the train as she fought back the tears
when the dust had settled on her dreams months had turned to years
working fingers to the bone left no time for tears
still every time she'd hear that whistle blow her mind went racing back
to the train that left that prairie town running on a one way track
she knew he was his father's son so it came as no surprise
when billy said i'm headen west to see the ocean meet the sky
he said i won't be long momma don't you cry but she knew better than that
every train that leaves a prairie town is running on a one way track
with his nose to the window of that highballing train
thundering cross the prairies like a hurricane 
through the mountains out to the pacific shore
life wouldn't ever be the same no more
now late at night when the city sleeps he swears he sometimes hears
a soft wind through the prairie grass a sweet voice in his ear
but as billy stumbles through the night he knows there ain't no turning back
every train that leaves a prairie town is running on a one way track
she awoke one morning to a knock on her door six months to the day
he said i hate to have to bear the news your son has passed away
she was there at the station when the train rolled in bringing billy back
every train that leaves a prairie town is running on a one way track
running on a one way track

how do you explain the way
the stars just hang way up in the sky
and how do you explain the way
rain goes away whenever you walk by
it's a mystery just how life can lead
to a place you've never been a place you've never been
you've knocked on that door
a hundred times before
when it suddenly let you in

i don't know why
i've been so blessed
to love someone like you someone like you
i don't know why
i must confess
i only know i do

the stationmaster looked all around
along the track both up and down
but the train could not be found
for there was neither sight or sound
there was neither sight or sound
he walked on slowly to the station door
like so many times before
he looked outside into a sunshine beam
closed his eyes and dreamed a dream
drifted off into a dream
the winds of change forever blow
some things stay and some things go
the falling rain must melt the snow
the orangedale whistle will always blow
years ago throughout this land
that line was laid by able men
but things are changed as time goes by
people drive and people fly
people drive and people fly
the stationmaster is long since gone
he faded off into the sun
but the whistle shrill still lingers on
in the hearts of everyone
everyday from dusk till dawn
the winds of change forever blow
some things stay and some things go
the falling rain must melt the snow
the orangedale whistle will always blow 
well i can stand beside
ideals i think are right
and i can stand beside
the idea to stand and fight
i do believe
there's a dream for everyone
this is our country
there's room enough here
for science to live
and there's room enough here
for religion to forgive
and try to understand
all the people of this land
this is our country
from the east coast
to the west coast
down the dixie highway
back home
this is our country
that poverty could be
just another ugly thing
and bigotry would be
seen only as obscene
and the ones that run this land
help the poor and common man
this is our country
from the east coast
to the west coast
down the dixie highway
back home
this is our country
the dream is still alive
some day it will come true
and this country it belongs
to folks like me and you
so let the voice of freedom
sing out through this land
this is our country
from the east coast
to the west coast
down the dixie highway
back home
this is our country
from the east coast
to the west coast
down the dixie highway
back home
this is our country 


i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
he's got a onehand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around 
turn the radio down
he says baby is somethin' wrong
i say nothing
i was just thinkin' how we don't have a song
and he says
our song is the slammin' screen door
sneakin' out late tappin' on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date man i didn't kiss her and i should have
and when i got home before i said amen
askin' god if he could play it again
i was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
had gone all wrong or been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway well on my way to my lovin' bed
i almost didn't notice all the roses
and the note that said
our song is the slammin' screen door
sneakin' out late tappin' on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date man i didn't kiss her and i should have
and when i got home before i said amen
askin' god if he could play it again
i've heard every album 
listened to the radio
waited for something to come along
that was as good as our song
'cause our song is the slammin' screen door
sneakin' out late tappin' on his window
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date man i didn't kiss him and i should have
and when i got home before i said amen
askin' god if he could play it again
play it again
i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song 

we went out last night
like we swore we wouldnít do
drank too much beer last night
a lot more than we wanted to
there were girls from argentina and arkansas
maine alabama and panama
all mixed together and having a ball

yeah we went went out last night
one thing started leading to another
out last night
getting to know everybody and their mother
there were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
singing ìi got you babeî by sonny and cher
yeah life was good everywhere
we went out last night
well you know iím a music man
i grew up in east tennessee
last night i was everything
when i got a few drinks in me
i was a doctor a lawyer a senatorís son
brad pittís brother and a man on the run
anything i thought would get the job done

yeah we went out last night
one thing started leading to another
out last night
getting to know everybody and their mother
there were people doing body shots up on the bar
jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
everybody was some kind of star
when we went out last night
well the fact that iím still breathing
means that i must have survived
and that i lived to go out with my friends again tonight

oh we went out last night
one thing started leading to another
out last night
everybody started loving on each other
they were dancing on the tables
and howling at the moon
pairing up together and pretty soon
there was not a sole in sight
when we went out last night 



papa drove a truck nearly all his life
you know it drove mama crazy bein a trucker's wife
the part she couldn't handle was the bein' alone
i guess she needed more to hold than just the telephone
papa called mama each and every night
just to ask her how she was and if us kids were all right
mama would wait for that call to come in
but when daddy'd hang up she was gone again
momma was a looker
lord how she shined
papa was a good'n 
but the jealous kind
papa loved mama
mama loved men
mama's in the graveyard
papa's in the pen
well it was bound to happen
one night it did
papa came home and it was just us kids
he had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
if he was lookin to surprise her he was doin' fine
i heard him cry for mama up and down the hall
then i heard the bottle break against the bedroom wall
that ol' diesel engine made an eerie sound
when papa fired it up and headed into town
well the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
papa's rig was buried in the local motel
the desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
he never hit the brakes and he was shifting gears
momma was a looker
lord how she shined
papa was a good'n 
but the jealous kind
papa loved mama
mama loved men
mama's in the graveyard
papa's in the pen 
i realized the way your eyes deceived me
with tender looks that i mistook for love
so take away the flowers that you gave me
and send the kind that you remind me of
paper roses
paper roses
oh how real those roses seem to be
but they're only imitation
like you imitation love for me
i thought that you would be a perfect lover
you seemed so full of sweetness at the start
but like a big red rose that's made of paper
there isn't any sweetness in your heart
paper roses
paper roses
oh how real those roses seem to be
but they're only imitation like you imitation love for me 
david lee murphyjimbeau hinson

if you don't take me to paris on a lover's getaway it's alright it's alright
if i'd rather wear your tshirt than a sexy negligee it's alright it's alright
every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit
it's kinda nice to know that it 
doesn't have to be perfect
maybe every little piece of the puzzle doesn't always fit perfectly
love can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams
honey if it's good enough for you it's good enough for me
if your mother doesn't like the way i treat her baby boy it's alright it's alright
if in every wedding picture my daddy looks annoyed it's alright it's alright

real love and real life
doesn't have to be perfect

love can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams

oh you don't mind if i show up late for everything
when you lose your cool it's kinda cute to me

don't have to be perfect
maybe every little piece of the puzzle doesn't always fit perfectly
love can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams

oh you're good enough for me uh huh
yeah you're good enough for me
oh you're good enough for me

and moonlight falls across your floor

i had you and you had me
please remember please remember 
dwight yoakam
inside the pocket of a clown
is a sad place to hang around
just watching smiles turn into frowns
inside the pocket of a clown
inside the heartache of a fool
you'll learn things they don't teach in school
and lessons there can be real cruel
inside the heartache of a fool
hollow lies
make a thin disguise
as little drops of truth
fall from your eyes
hollow lies
make a thin disguise
as little drops of truth
fall from your eyes
inside a memory from the past
lies every love that didn't last
and sweet dreams can start to fade real fast
inside a memory from the past
yeah it's a real sad place to hang around
inside the pocket of a clown 
dwight yoakam

i've been lately thinkin' about my life's time
all the things i've done and how it's been
and i can't help believin' in my own mind
i know i'm gonna hate to see it end
i've seen a lot of sunshine slept out in the rain
spent a night or two all on my own
i've known my lady's pleasures had myself some friends
spent a time or two in my own home
and i have to say it now it's been a good life all in all
it's really fine to have the chance to hang around
lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire
while all my friends and my old lady sit and pass a pipe around
and talk of poems and prayers and promises and things that we believe in
how sweet it is to love someone how right it is to care
how long it's been since yesterday what about tomorrow
and what about our dreams and all the memories we share
the days they pass so quickly now nights are seldom long
time around me whispers when it's cold 
the changes somehow frighten me still i have to smile
it turns me on to think of growing old
for though my life's been good to me there's still so much to do
so many things my mind has never known
i'd like to raise a family i'd like to sail away
and dance across the mountains on the moon
and i have to say it now it's been a good life all in all
it's really fine to have the chance to hang around
lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire
while all my friends and my old lady sit and pass a pipe around
and talk of poems and prayers and promises and things that we believe in
how sweet it is to love someone how right it is to care
how long it's been since yesterday what about tomorrow
and what about our dreams and all the memories we share 

pop a top again
i just got time for one more round
sit em up my friends
then i'll be gone
then you can let some other fool sit down
i'd like for you'd to listen to a joke i heard today
from a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
i'd tried to smile and did a while it felt so outta place
did you ever hear of a clown with tears drops streamming down his face
pop a top again
i think i'll have another round
sit em up my friend
then i'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down
home for me is misery and here i am wasting time
cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind
but then you see her leaving me it's not what i perfer
so it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her
pop a top again
i think i'll have another round
sit em up my friend 
then i'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down
pop a top again 




written by kiddkennedy
got a date a week from friday with a preacher's son
everybody says he's crazy
i'll have to see
i finally moved to jackson when the summer came
i won't have to pay that boy to rake my leaves
i'm probably going on and on
it seems i'm doing more of that these days
 1
i probably wouldn't be this way
i probably wouldn't hurt so bad
i never pictured every minute without you in it
oh you left so fast
sometimes i see you standing there
sometimes it's like i'm losing touch
sometimes i feel that i'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
god gave me a moment's grace
cause if i'd never seen your face
i probably wouldn't be this way
mama says that i just shouldn't speak to you
susan says that i should just move on
you oughta see the way these people look at me
when they see me round here talking to this stone
everybody thinks i've lost my mind
but i just take it day by day
 2
i probably wouldn't be this way
i probably wouldn't hurt so bad
i never pictured every minute without you in it
oh you left so fast
sometimes i see you standing there
sometimes i feel an angel's touch
sometimes i feel that i'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
god gave me a moment's grace
cause if i'd never seen your face
i probably wouldn't be this way
i probably wouldn't be this way
got a date a week from friday with a preacher's son
everybody says i'm crazy
guess i'll have to see 
i dropped to my knees
in that field on your daddy's farm
asked you to marry me
all i had to give was my heart
while other kids were divin' in the swimming holes
you and me dove off into the great unknown
we were barely getting by taking care of each other
and i became a daddy
you became a mother
it was an uphill battle nearly every day
looking back i wouldn't have it any other way

i'm proud of the house we built
it's stronger than sticks stones and stilt
it's not a big place sitting up high on some hill
lot of things will come and go
but love never will
oh i'm proud
i'm proud of the house we built
still working our way through the land of milk and honey
at the end of the day there's always more bills than money
i close my eyes at night and i still feel
the same fire in my heart out in that field

i'm proud of the house we built
it's stronger than sticks stones and stilt
it's not a big place sitting up high on some hill
lot of things will come and go
but love never will
i'm proud
oh i'm proud of the house we built
oh look at us together
oh we've come such a long long way
 x2
i'm proud of the house we built
it's stronger than sticks stones and steel
it's not a big place sitting up high on some hill
lot of things come and go
but love never will
i'm proud
yeah i'm proud of the house we built 
out of nowhere this
gust of wind
brushed my hair
and kissed my skin
i aimed to hold a bridled pace
when with love itself
i came face to face
pullin back the reins
trying to remain
tall in the saddle
when all that we had well
ran away
with a will of its own
i know your soul is wild and free
like this galloping
inside me
tossed by instinct
and where we land
is vast and certain of all that's planned
pullin back the reins
trying to remain
tall in the saddle
when all that we had
well ran away
with a will of its own
you know i finally learned to
break the run
and gently harness the love of someone
and equal parts of wait and trust
is in control of the both of us
pullin back the reins
tryin to remain
tall in the saddle
when all that we had well
ran away
ran away
ran away

your mind is made up you won't even try
you didn't even cry this time
you say that we could never see eye to eye
and one of us just must be blind
we have our differences
we're still the same
we see just what we want to see
but you take a second look
and maybe things wouldn't seem the same
if you could see what you mean to me
put yourself in my shoes
walk a mile for me
you know i'll put myself in your shoes
maybe then we'd see
that if you put yourself in my shoes
you'd have some sympathy
and if i could only put myself in your shoes
you know i'd walk right back to me
  
you're gonna keep walkin' 
you're gonna pass me by
you said you don't even care
but i could always recognize a real goodbye
and i know your heart's not there
we've have our differences
we're still the same
we just hear only what we want to hear
now i'm head over heels i'm in the lost and found
it's a cryin' shame
i thought we made the perfect pair
put yourself in my shoes
walk a while walk that mile for me
i'll put myself in your shoes
maybe then we'd see ohh
that if you put yourself in my shoes
you'd have some sympathy for me
and if i could only put myself in your shoes
you know i'd walk right back to me
you know i'd walk right back to me
you know i'd walk i'd walk right back to me 
midnight
and i'm awaiting
on the twelveohfive
hoping it'll take me
just a little farther down the line
moonlight
you're just a heartache in disguise
won't you keep my heart from breaking
if it's only for a very short time
playing with the queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really smart
the joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you
laying out another lie
thinking 'bout a life of crime
that's what i'll have to do
to keep me away from you
honey you know it makes you mad
why is everybody telling everybody
what you have done
baby i know it makes you sad
but when they're handing out the heartaches
you know you got to have you some
playing with the queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really smart
the joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you
laying out another lie
thinking 'bout a life of crime
that's what i'll have to do
to keep me away from you
lovers i know you've had a few
but hide your heart beneath the covers
and tell 'em they're the only one
and others they know just
what i'm going through
and it's ahard to be a lover
when you say you're only in it for fun
playing with the queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really smart
the joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you
playing with the queen of hearts
knowing it ain't really smart
the joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you
laying out another lie
thinking 'bout a life of crime
that's what i'll have to do
to keep me away from you
playing with the queen of hearts
repeat and fade 
i feel tears wellin' up cold deep inside
like my heart's sprung a big break
and a stab of lonliness sharp and painful
that i may never shake
you might say that i was taking it hard
since you wrote me off with a call
but don't you wager that i'll hide in sorrow
when i may lay right down and bawl
 
now the race is on
and here comes pride in the backstretch
heartaches goin' to the inside
my tears are holdin' back
they're tryin' not to fall
my hearts out of the runnin'
true love's scratched for another's sake
the race is on and it looks like heartache
and the winner loses all
one day i ventured in love
never once suspectin' what the final result would be
and how i lived in fear of waking up each morning 
finding that you're gone from me 
there's ache and pain in my heart
for today was the one that i hated to face
somebody new came up to win her 
and i came out in second place
 
now the race is on
and here comes pride in the backstretch
heartaches goin' to the inside
my tears are holdin' back
they're tryin' not to fall
my hearts out of the runnin'
true love's scratched for another's sake
the race is on and it looks like heartache
and the winner loses all 


raindrops keep fallin' on my head
and just like the guy who's feet are too big for his bed
nothing seems to fit
those
raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep fallin'
so i just did me some talking to the sun
and i said i didn't like the way he got things done
sleeping on the job
those
raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep fallin'
but there's one thing i know
the blues they sent to meet me won't defeat me
it won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
raindrops keep fallin' on my head
but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
crying's not for me 'cause
i'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
because i'm free
nothing's worrying me
it won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
raindrops keep fallin' on my head
but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
crying 's not for me
cause i'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
because i'm free
nothing's worrying me 
when the train rolls by
i'm gonna be ready this time
when the boy gets that look in his eye
i'm gonna be ready this time
when my momma said i look good in white
i'm gonna be ready this time
oh yeah
ready ready ready ready ready to run
all i'm ready to do is have some fun
what's all this talk about love
i feel the wind blow through my hair
i'm gonna be ready this time
i'll buy a ticket to anywhere

you see it feels like i'm starting to care
and i'm gonna be ready this time ready this time
oh yeah
ready ready ready ready ready to run
all i'm ready to do is have some fun
what's all this talk about love

she's gotta do what she's gotta do
and i've gotta like it or not
she's got dreams too big for this town
and she needs to give 'em a shot
whatever they are
looks like she's all ready to leave
nothing left to pack
there ain't no room for me in that car
even if she asked me to tag along
god i gotta be strong
she's at the startin' line of the rest of her life
as ready as she's ever been
got the hunger and the stars in her eyes
the prize is hers to win
she's waitin' on my blessings before she hits that open road
baby get ready
get set
don't go
she says things are fallen into place
feels like they're fallen apart
i painted this big ol' smile on my face
to hide my broken heart
if only she knew
this is where i don't say what i want so bad to say
this is where i want to but i won't get in the way
of her and her dreams
and spreadin' her wings
she's at the startin' line of the rest of her life
as ready as she's ever been
got the hunger and the stars in her eyes
the prize is hers to win
she's waitin' on my blessings before she hits that open road
baby get ready

redneck girl likes to cruise in daddy's pickup truck
and a redneck girl plays hard when she's down on her luck
living for friday afternoon
she's gonna show one ol' boy that weekend moon
and i pray that someday i will find me a redneck girl
a redneck girl likes to stay out all night long
she makes sweet rock and roll while she listens to the country songs
she's waiting for that moment of surrender
her hands are callused but her heart is tender
and i pray that someday i will find me a redneck girl
gimme a gimme a gimme a redneck girl
gimme a gimme a gimme a redneck girl
gimme a gimme a gimme a redneck girl
gimme a gimme a gimme a redneck girl
redneck girl got her name on the back of her belt
she's got a kiss on her lips for her man and no one else
the coyote is howling out on the prairie
first comes love then comes marriage
and i pray that someday i will find me a redneck girl

last monday morning you left with no warning
i started going insane well i headed south out of del rio texas
with a hell of a load on my brain i kept on going
without even knowing how much your love really means
now i messed up in mexico living on refried dreams
refrain 
i'm down here in mexico sick as a dog
my head is pounding in this border town fog
down to my last dime and coming apart at the seams
i messed up in mexico living on refried dreams
this picture ain't pretty 
i'm ragged and dirty
and wondering what i'm doing here
shooting tequila wantin' to kill ya
and wishin to god you were near
so full of your memory 
but feeling so empty
i've run out of my selfesteem
now i messed up in mexico living on refried dreams
refrain 2x
oh i'm stuck here in mexico living on refried dreams 
you told me once that you were mine alone forever
and i was yours till the end of eternity
but all those vows are broken now and we will never be the same except in memory
remember me when the candle lights're gleaming
remember me at the close of a long long day
it would be so sweet when all alone i'm dreaming
just to know you still remember me
 guitar  piano 
a brighter face may take my place when we're apart dear
another love with a heart more bold than free
but in the end fearweather friends may break your heart dear
if they do sweetheart remember me
remember me when the candle
just to know you still remember me 
remember when i was young and so were you
and time stood still and love was all we knew
you were the first so was i
we made love and then you cried
remember when
remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
gave our hearts made the start and it was hard
we lived and learned life threw curves
there was joy there was hurt
remember when
remember when old ones died and new were born
and life was changed disassembled rearranged
we came together fell apart
and broke each others hearts
remember when
remember when the sound of little feet was the music we danced to week to week
brought back the love we found trust
vowed we never give it up
remember when
remember when thirty seemed so old
now lookin' back its just a steppin' stone
to where we are
where we've been
said we do it all again
remember when
remember when we said when we turn gray
when the children grow up and move away
we won't be sad we'll be glad
for all the life we've had 
and we'll remember when
remember when
remember when 

reuben james in my song you live again
and the phrase that i rhyme are just a footstep out of time
from the time when i knew you reuben james
reuben james all the folks around hadison county
cussed your name
you're just a nocount sharecropping colored man
you'd steal anything you can
and everybody laid the blame on reuben james
reuben james for you still walk over fields of my mind
faded shirt weathered brow caloused hands upon the plow
loved you then and i love you now reuben james
for a grave the gossiper of hadison county died with chid
although your skin was black
you were the one that didn't turn your back
on the hungry white child with no name reuben james
reuben james with your mind on the soul
and a bottle in your right hand
you said turn the other cheek
for there's a better world awaiting for the meek
in my mind these words remain from reuben james
reuben james for you still walk over fields of my mind
faded shirt weathered brow caloused hands upon the plow
loved you then and i love you now reuben james
reuben james one dark cloudy day
they brought you from the field
and to your lonely pinebox
came just a preacher me and the rain
just to sing one last refrain to reuben james
reuben james for you still walk over fields of my mind
faded shirt weathered brow caloused hands upon the plow
loved you then and i love you now reuben james
reuben james for you still walk over fields of my mind
faded shirt weathered brow caloused hands upon the plow
loved you then and i love you now reuben james 
i've been walkin' these streets so long
singin' the same old song
i know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of broadway
where hustle's the name of the game
and nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
there's been a load of compromisin'
on the road to my horizon 
but i'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a starspangled rodeo
like a rhinestone cowboy
getting cards and letters from people i don't even know
and offers comin' over the phone
well i don't really mind the rain
and a smile can hide all the pain
but you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
and i dream of the things i'll do
with a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
there'll be a load of compromisin'
on the road to my horizon 
but i'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a starspangled rodeo
rhinestone cowboy
gettin' cards and letters from people i don't even know
and offers comin' over the phone
like a rhinestone cowboy
riding out on a horse in a starspangled rodeo
like a rhinestone cowboy
gettin' cards and letters from people i don't even know
like a rhinestone cowboy 
i've been walkin' these streets so long
singin' the same old song
i know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of broadway
where hustle's the name of the game

so you speak to me of sadness and the coming of the winter
the fear that is within you now it seems to never end
the dreams that have escaped you 
and the hopes that you've forgotten
you tell me that you need me now
you want to be my friend
and you wonder where we're going
where's the rhyme and where is the reason
and if you cannot accept it is here we must begin
to seek the wisdom of the children
and the graceful way of flowers in the wind 
for the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers
their laughter and their loveliness could clear a cloudy day
like the music of the mountains and the colors of the rainbow
they're a promise of the future and a blessing for today
though the cities start to crumble and the towers fall around us
the sun is slowly fading and it's colder than the sea
it is written from the desert to the mountains they shall lead us 
by the hand and by the heart they will comfort you and me
in their innocence and trusting they will teach us to be free
for the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers
their laughter and their loveliness could clear a cloudy day
and the song that i am singing is a prayer to nonbelievers
come and stand beside us we can find a better way 
know all about yeah bout your reputation
and now it's bound to be a heartbreak situation
but i can't help it if i'm helpless
every time that i'm where you are
you walk in and my strength walks out the door
say my name and i can't fight it anymore
oh i know i should go but i need your touch just too damn much
loving you that isn't really something i should do
shouldn't wanna spend my time with you yeah
well i should try to be strong but baby you're the right kind of wrong
yeah baby you're the right kind of wrong
might be a mistake  a mistake i'm makin'
but what you're givin' i am happy to be takin'
'cause no one's ever made me feel the way i feel when i'm in your arms
they say you're something i should do without
they don't know what goes on when the lights go out
there's no way to explain  
all the pleasure is worth all the pain
loving you that isn't really something i should do
shouldn't wanna spend my time with you yeah
well i should try to be strong but baby you're the right kind of wrong
yeah baby you're the right kind of wrong
i should try to run but i just can't seem to
'cause every time i run you're the one i run to
can't do without what you do to me
i don't care if i'm in too deep yeah
know all about yeah bout your reputation
and now it's bound to be a heartbreak situation
but i can't help it if i'm helpless
every time that i'm where you are
you walk in and my strength walks out the door
say my name and i can't fight it anymore
oh i know i should go but i need your touch just too damn much yeah
loving you yeah that isn't really something i should do
i shouldn't wanna spend my time with you yeah
well i should try to be strong i should try to be strong
but baby you're the right kind of wrong right kind of wrong
baby you're the right kind of wrong
baby you're the right kind of wrong
yeah baby you're the right kind of wrong 
let's begin with the day i met her
how fast this good old boys world got better
the sky got bluer the grass got greener
just the first few seconds after i first seen her
like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
my best old jeans and my broken sneakers
a home run pitch floatin right down the middle
sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

she's right on the money
she goes direct to my heart
when it comes to loving me
she's everything i need
bulls eye perfect
she's right on the money
she's no red lights when ive over slept
she's a three point jump shot thats nothin but net
a hand full of aces when the dealers done dealin
im forever on a roll thats how shes got me feelin

she's the best cook thats ever melted cheese
i ain't much around the house but i aim to please
theres absolutley no reason to doubt it
when she says i wouldn't last ten minutes without her
 
sun goes down on a silky day
quarter moon walkin' thru the milky way
when it's me and you baby
we could think of somethin' to do
'cause it's the right time of the night
oh the stars are winkin' above
honey it's the right time of the night 
for makin' love
we'll go drinkin' in some heavy bar
i'll take you night ridin' in my chevy car
when it's me and you baby
we could think of somethin' to do
'cause it's the right time of the night
oh the stars are winkin' above
honey it's the right time of the night
for makin' love
i got you and you got me
tell you that's the way my momma
always said it should be 
i'll be sweet and you'll be kind
we'll be bad if you don't mind
it's the right time of the night
oh the stars are winkin' above
honey it's the right time of the night 
for makin' love 
love is a burning thing
and it makes a fiery ring 
bound by wild desire 
i fell in to a ring of fire 
i fell in to a burning ring of fire
i went down down down 
and the flames went higher
and it burns burns burns
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire
i fell in to a burning ring of fire 
i went down down down 
and the flames went higher 
and it burns burns burns 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire 
the taste of love is sweet 
when hearts like ours meet 
i fell for you like a child 
oh but the fire went wild 
i fell in to a burning ring of fire 
i went down down down 
and the flames went higher 
and it burns burns burns 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire 
i fell into a burning ring of fire 
i went down down down 
and the flames went higher 
and it burns burns burns 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire 
and it burns burns burns 
the ring of fire 
the ring of fire

you know a dream is a like a river
ever changing as it flows
and the dreamer's just a vessel
that must follow where it goes
trying to learn from what's behind you
and never knowing what's in store
makes each day a constant battle
just to stay between the shores and

i will sail my vessel
'til the river runs dry
like a bird upon the wind
these waters are my sky
i'll never reach my destination
if i never try
so i will sail my vessel
'til the river runs dry
too many times we stand aside
let the waters slip away
'til what we put off 'til tomorrow
it has now become today
so don't you sit upon the shoreline
and say you're satisfied
choose to chance the rapids
and dare to dance the tide yes

there's bound to be rough waters
and i know i'll take some falls
but with the good lord as my captain
i can make it through them allyes

yes i will sail my vessel
'til the river runs dry
'til the river runs dry

he was born in the summer of his 27th year
coming home to a place he'd never been before
he left yesterday behind him you might say he was born again
you might say he found a key for every door
when he first came to the mountains his life was far away
on the road and hanging by a song
but the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
it keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long
it's the colorado rocky mountain high
i've seen it raining fire in the sky
the shadows from the starlight are softer than a lullaby
rocky mountain high colorado
rocky mountain high high in colorado
he climbed cathedral mountains he saw silver clouds below
he saw everything as far as you can see
and they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
and he lost a friend but kept the memory
now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
seeking grace in every step he takes
his sight is turned inside himself to try and understand
the serenity of a clear blue mountain lake
and the colorado rocky mountain high
i've seen it raining fire in the sky
talk to god and listen to the casual reply
rocky mountain high high in colorado
rocky mountain high high in colorado
now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
of the simple things he can not comprehend
why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
more people more scars upon the land
in the colorado rocky mountain high
i've seen it raining fire in the sky
i know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
rocky mountain high
the colorado rocky mountain high
i've seen it raining fire in the sky
friends around the campfire and everybody's high
rocky mountain high high in colorado
rocky mountain high high in colorado
rocky mountain high high in colorado
rocky mountain high high in colorado
rocky mountain high high in colorado
rocky mountain high high in colorado 
wish that i was on old rocky top
down in the tennessee hills
ain't no smoggy smoke on rocky top
ain't no telephone bills
once i had a girl on rocky top
half bear the other half cat
wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop
i still dream about that
rocky top you'll always be
home sweet home to me
good ole rocky top rocky top tennessee
rocky top tennessee
once two strangers climbed old rocky top
looking for a moonshine still
strangers ain't come down from rocky top
reckon they never will
corn won't grow at all on rocky top
dirt's too rocky by far
that's why all the folks on rocky top
get their corn from a jar
rocky top you'll always be
home sweet home to me
good ole rocky top rocky top tennessee
rocky top tennessee
  
i've had years of cramped up city life
trapped like a duck in a pen
all i know is it's a pity life
can't be simple again
rocky top you'll always be
home sweet home to me
good ole rocky top rocky top tennessee
rocky top tennessee
rocky top tennessee 


his eyes are cold and restless
his wounds have almost healed
and she'd give half of texas
just to change the way he feels
she knows his love's in tulsa
and she knows he's gonna go
well it ain't no woman flesh and blood
it's that damned old rodeo
well it's balls and blood
it's dust and mud
it's the roar of a sunday crowd
it's the white in his knuckles
the gold in the buckle
he'll win the next go 'round
it's boots and chaps
it's cowboy hats
it's spurs and latigo
it's the ropes and the reins
and the joy and the pain
and they call the thing rodeo
she does her best to hold him
when his love comes to call
but his need for it controls him
and her back's against the wall
and it's so long girl i'll see you
when it's time for him to go
you know the woman wants her cowboy
like he wants his rodeo
well it's balls and blood
it's dust and mud
it's the roar of a sunday crowd
it's the white in his knuckles
the gold in the buckle
he'll win the next go 'round
it's boots and chaps
it's cowboy hats
it's spurs and latigo
it's the ropes and the reins
and the joy and the pain
and they call the thing rodeo
it'll drive a cowboy crazy
it'll drive a man insane
and he'll sell off everything he owns
just to pay to play her game
and a broken home and some broken bones
is all he'll have to show
for all the years that he spent chasin'
this dream they call rodeo
well it's balls and blood
it's dust and mud
it's the roar of a sunday crowd
it's the white in his knuckles
the gold in the buckle
he'll win the next go 'round
it's boots and chaps
it's cowboy hats
it's spurs and latigo
it's the ropes and the reins
and the joy and the pain
and they call the thing rodeo
it's the broncs and the blood
it's the steers and the mud
and they call the thing rodeo 




wake up in the morning
get to living my life
making sure im all that i can be
went to church on sunday
there was a moment that came
i swear it was like the lord spoke right to me

so now im slowing it down
and im looking around
and im loving this town
and im doing alright
aint worried about nothing
except for the man i wanna be
im thinking maybe its time
to be living the rhyme
when im singing a song
about nothing but right
and it sure would be nice 
if you would roll with me
saw a kid last winter
only 20 years old
being laid to rest
while his mom stood by his side
it sure was hard to watch those tears run down her face
made me think how we all just have our time

who knows whats up ahead
i think id rather not know instead

maybe its time
to be living the rhyme
when im singing a song
about nothing but right
and it sure would be nice 
if you would roll with me
if you would roll with me x2 
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
when you take you gotta give so live and let live and let go oh oh oh oh
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
i could promise you things like big diamond rings
but you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
so you better think it over
well if sweet talking you could make it come true
i would give you the world right now on a silver platter
but what would it matter
so smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
come along and share the good times while we can
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
i could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
but if that's what it takes to hold you i'd just as soon let you go
but there's one thing i want you to know
you'd better look before you leap still waters run deep
and there won't always be someone there to pull you out
and you know what i'm talking about
so smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
come along and share the good times while we can
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime 
from the island of vancouver
to the isle of newfoundland
theres daisys by the wayside
and the pasture's green again 
the bluejay on the fence post
has summer in his song
while out on the open highway i thumb my way along
roving all over the land
roving all over the land
with a knapsack on my shoulder
and a flat top by my side
i roam the great north country 
and feel so free inside
there stops an old hay wagon
i climb up on the load
where i munch on a big red apple as we jog along the road
roving all over the land
roving all over the land
you'll find me by the river
where the lively otter plays
or asleep by the meadow
where the lazy cattle graze
you'll find me in the backseat 
of a car that moves along
to the music of my flat top on an old hitchhikers song
roving all over the land
roving all over the land
here comes an old truck driver
i know by the way he smiles
i'll sing and pick my flat top 
for the next 200 miles
and a little voice will tell me
i've made another friend
i'll share his bacon sandwich and i'm on the road again
roving all over the land
roving all over the land
from the island of vancouver
to the isle of newfoundland
theres daisys by the wayside
and the pasture's green again 
the bluejay on the fence post
has summer in his song
while out on the open highway i thumb my way along
roving all over the land
roving all over the land
roving all over the land
roving all over the land
roving all over the land

we're only human baby

we lose our way
we come unwound
we'll turn in circles baby
we're never satisfied
we'll fall from grace
forget we can fly
but through all the tears that we cried
we'll survive
cause when we're torn apart
shattered and scarred
love has the grace to save us
we're just two tarnished hearts
when in each other's arms
we become saints and angels
i love your imperfections
i love your everything
your broken heart your broken wings
i love you when you hold me
and when you turn away
i love you still and i'm not afraid
cause i know you feel the same way
and you'll stay
cause when we're torn apart
shattered and scarred
love has the grace to save us
we're just two tarnished hearts
when in each other's arms
we become saints and angels
these feet of clay these feet of clay
they will not stray
cause when we're torn apart
shattered and scarred
love has the grace to save us
we're just two tarnished hearts
when in each other's arms
we become saints and angels
saints and angels 
while they dance
how she holds him
pulls him close
and loves him so
while he dreams of another
and counts the days 
until he lets her go
same old story
that everybody knows
it's one heart holdin' on
one letting go
while they ride
lord he tells her
how they two
will settle down
but she only hears the highway
and a voice
in some other town
and the harder
he holds her
the more she slips away
same old story
that everybody knows
its one heart holdin' one 
one letting go
same old story

dumdededum dededumdededum dedaadaadaadaadaaaa
well i walk into the room
passing out hundred dollar bills
and it kills and it thrills like the horns on my silverado grill
and i buy the bar a double round of crown
and everybody's getting down
an' this town ain't never gonna be the same

cause i saddle up my horse
and i ride into the city
i make a lot of noise
cause the girls
they are so pretty
riding up and down broadway
on my old stud leroy
and the girls say
save a horse ride a cowboy
everybody says
save a horse ride a cowboy
well i don't give a dang about nothing
i'm singing and bling blanging
while the girls are drinking
long necks down
and i wouldn't trade ol' leroy
or my chevrolet for your escalade
or your freak parade
i'm the only john wayne left in this town
and i saddle up my horse
and i ride into the city
i make a lot of noise
cause the girls
they are so pretty
riding up and down broadway
on my old stud leroy
and the girls say
save a horse ride a cowboy
everybody says
save a horse ride a cowboy
spoken
i'm a thouroughbred
that's what she said
in the back of my truck bed
as i was gettin' buzzed on suds
out on some back country road
we where flying high
fine as wine having ourselves a big and rich time
and i was going just about as far as she'd let me go
but her evaluation
of my cowboy reputation
had me begging for salvation
all night long
so i took her out giggin frogs
introduced her to my old bird dog
and sang her every willie nelson song i could think of
and we made love
and i saddled up my horse
and i ride into the city
i make a lot of noise
cause the girls
they are so pretty
riding up and down broadway
on my old stud leroy
and the girls say
save a horse ride a cowboy
everybody says
save a horse ride a cowboy
what what
save a horse ride a cowboy
everybody says
save a horse ride a cowboy 
i stood outside the lucky star
staring at the flashing sign
it read come on in and watch young
scarlet's body come alive
let her dance for you and catch your spell
you'll swear you can believe her
be careful not to catch the scarlet fever
so i paid my fare and walked down front
and found an empty chair
as i settled in young scarlet took the ribbons from her hair
the moves her body made while the music played
were the likes i've never seen
and she became the envy of my dreams
one by one her teasing movements
brought the crowd out of their seats
and all at once young scarlet
danced straight up in front of me
from the moment that her eyes found mine
i've never been the same
scarlet locked another heart upon her chain
now i get scarlet fever every time i see her
but she's a night club teaser
not paid to notice me
yes i get scarlet fever
if she knew how much i need her
she'd place her hand in my hand
and dance away with me
she looked 25 but i was told
that she was just 16
she had a way of making a man believe
she danced for only him
as she tantalized i fantasized
and felt the sound of my heart beat
and every night i'd dream
she'd fall in love with me
then one night while driving in
my eyes begun to tear
'cause the sign outside the lucky star
said scarlet isn't here
she'd left that day to find a life
of bigger and better things
and she left behind my chain of broken dreams
but still get scarlet fever
in my mind i still see her
out there dancing somewhere
to another fool like me
yes i get scarlet fever every time i see her
but she's a night club teaser
not paid to notice me
yes i get scarlet fever
if she knew how much i need her
she'd place her hand in my hand
and dance away with me 
i left out of tucson with no destination in mind
i was runnin' from trouble and the jailterm the judge had in mind
and the border meant freedom a new life romance
and that's why i thought i should go
and start my life over on the seashores of old mexico
my first night in juarez lost all the money i had
one bad senorita made use of one innocent lad
but i must keep on runnin' it's too late to turn back
i'm wanted in tucson i'm told
yeah an' things'll blow over on the seashores of old mexico
two mexican farmers en route to a town i can't say
let me ride on the back of a flatbed halfloaded with hay
down through durangopalimapalmira
then in the manzanio
where i slept in the sunshine on the seashores of old mexico
after one long siesta i came wide awake in the night
i was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
my newfound companion one young senorita
who offered a broken hello
to the gringo she found on the seashores of old mexico
she spoke of sonora and swore that she'd never return
for her mexican husband she really had no great concern
'cause she loved the gringo my red hair and lingo
that's all i needed to know
yeah i found what i needed on the seashores of old mexico
yeah she loved the gringo my red hair and lingo
that's all i needed to know ha ha
yeah i found what i needed on the seashores of old mexico

gettin' soaked to the bone
this land as flat as it is mean
a man can see for a hundred miles
so i'm still paryin' i might see
the glow of the brake light
but your wheels just turn down the road ahead
if it hurts at all you ain't showed it yet
i keep lookin' for the slightest sign
that you might miss what you left behind
i know there's nothin' stoppin you now
but i'd settle for a slowdown
i held on longer than i should
believin' you might change your mind
and those bright lights of hollywood
would fade in time
but your wheels just turn down the road ahead
if it hurts at all you ain't showed it yet
i keep lookin' for the slightest sign
that you might miss what you left behind
i know there's nothin' stoppin you now
but i'd settle for a slowdown
but your wheels just turn down the road ahead
if it hurts at all you ain't showed it yet
you're just a tiny dot on that horizon line
come on tap those brakes baby just one time
i know there's nothin' stoppin' you now

when it comes to loving you
i'll do anything you want me to

and i'm standing
here for all the world to see
oh baby that's what's left of me
i don't have very far to fall
you know now i'm not a man who's ever been
insecure about the world i've been living in
i don't break easy i have my pride
but if you need to be satisfied
i'm shameless
honey i don't have a prayer
every time i see you standing there
i go down upon my knees
and i'm changing
swore i'd never compromise
oh but you convinced me otherwise
i'll do anything you please
you see in all my life i've never found
what i couldn't resist what i couldn't turn down
i could walk away from anyone i ever knew
but i can't walk away from you
i have never let anything have this much control on me
i've worked too hard to call my life my own
and i've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly
but it's your world now i can't refuse
i've never had so much to lose
oh i'm shameless
you know it should be easy for a man who's strong
to say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
i've never lost anything i ever missed
but i've never been in love like this
it's out of my hands
i'm shameless
i don't have the power now
and i don't want it anyhow
so i gotta let it go
why i'm shameless
shameless as a man can be
you could make a total fool of me
i just wanted you to know
why i'm shameless 
while she lays sleeping i stay out late at night and play my songs
and sometimes all the nights can be so long
and it's good when i finally make it home all alone
while she lays dreaming i try to get undressed without the light
and quietly she says how was your night
and i come to her and say it was all right and i hold her tight
and she believes in me i'll never know just what she sees in me
i told her someday if she was my girl i could change the world
with my little songs i was wrong
but she has faith in me and so i go on trying faithfully
and who knows maybe on some special night if my song is right
i will find a way find a way
while she lays waiting i stumble to the kitchen for a bite
then i see my old guitar in the night
just waiting for me like a secret friend and there's no end
while she lays crying i fumble with a melody or two
and i'm torn between the things that i should do
and she says to wake her up when i am through
god her love is true
and she believes in me i'll never know just what she sees in me
i told her someday if she was my girl i could change the world
with my little songs i was wrong
but she has faith in me and so i go on trying faithfully
and who knows maybe on some special night if my song is right
i will find a way while she waits while she waits for me for me 
while she lays sleeping i stay out late at night and play my songs
and sometimes all the nights can be so long
and it's good when i finally make it home all alone
while she lays dreaming i try to get undressed without the light

he said goodbye from the edge of the porch
like she'd been some casual friend
he said your better off with out me
i'm not what you need
like her momma had said about him
he started the car
pulled out of the drive
didn't waste any time lookin' back
she watched him go
thinkin' even a stranger
would show more compassion than that
she could've cried but she didn't have time
she had a baby to feed
a pink blanket to find
to rock their little one to sleep
she could've laid in bed for hours
giving misery the power
but she didn't have time
she got a sitterand she got a job
'cause she had a promise to keep
her day was a factory and evening survival
at night was exhaustion and sleep
sometimes she felt life was passing her by
and watching was all she could do
her friends said you gotta get outta the house
and maybe you'll meet someone new
she could've tried
but she didn't have time
she had a five year old to feed
she had ballet class piano lessons
and tball little league
she could've laid awake for hours
giving lonely nights the power
but she didn't have the time
not time where would she find the time
to trust a man again
not time for that flat tire
a crowded parking lot and then
not time but yes have coffee with the man
who got her tired fixed
she was thinking gosh he's handsome
when he asked do you have kids
she could've lied
but she didnt have time
all she said was she's five
he said i saw the car seat i love kids
does she have your eyes
and they sat and talked for hours
giving destiny it's power
she could've been afraid
to fall in love that night
but she didn't have time
she could've been afraid
to fall in love that night
but she didn't have time 
every now an' then on my home
i stop at a spot where the wild flowers grow an' i pick a few
'cause she don't tell me to
i go out with my boys all right
but most of the time i call it a night before they do
'cause she don't tell me to
sunday mornin' i'm in church
an' my butt an' my back an' necktie hurt but i'm in the pew
she don't tell me to
any other woman i know would have tried
to control me and it would be over
plannin' on my goin' on my own way attitude
all of that stubborness melts away
when i wake with her head on my shoulder
an' i know i've got to love her
until my life is through
'cause she don't tell me to
well i got demons and i've got pride
but when i'm wrong i apologise like she's mine to lose
'cause she don't tell me to
well i got dreams in this heart of mine
but nothin' that i wouldn't lay aside if she asked me to
'cause she don't tell me to
an' she don't even know
that she keeps lookin' for the next right thing to do
'cause she don't tell me to
yeah yeah
any other woman i know would have tried
to control me and it would be over
plannin' on my goin' on my own way attitude
and all of that stubborness melts away
when i wake with her head on my shoulder
an' i know i've got to love her
until my life is through
what else can i do 
what else can i do
whoa i love her
'cause she don't tell me to
she don't tell me to 
every now an' then on my home
i stop at a spot where the wild flowers grow an' i pick a few
yes i do 

billy was a small town loner
who never did dream
of ever leaving southern arizona
or ever hearing wedding bells ring
never had a lot of luck with the ladies 
but he sure had a lot of good working skills
never cared bout climbing any ladders
he knew the way
in a small cafe found the will
he met miss bonnie
and a little bit of her was a little to much
a few movies and a few months later
the feeling got strong enough
didn't know to call it
so it must of have been love
drove him up town for a diamond
thats when he started going 
over the line
working over time
to give her things
just to hear say  she don't deserve him
be he loves her and he just kept going
over board over the limit to afford
to give her her things he knew she wanted
cause without her where would he be
see it's not for him
she is his only need
ring on her finger and one on the ladder
new promotion every now and then
bonnie worked until she couldn't tie her apron
stayed at home and had the first of two children
my time did fly babies grew up and moved away
left them sitting on the front porch rocking
and billy watching bonnies hair turn grey
every once in a while you would see him get up 
and he'd head down town 
cause he heard about something she wanted 
and it just had to be found
didn't matter how simple or how much
it was love boy ain't that love just something
when it's strong enough to keep a man going
over the line
working over time
to giver her things 
just to hear her say she don't deseve him
but he loved her and he just kept going 
over board
over the limit to afford
to give her things he knew she wanted
cause without her where would he be
see it's not for him
she is his only need
over the line
working over time
she is his only need
overboard over the limit
just for her
she is his only need 
written by dean dillon and kerry kurt phil
he wondered how she'd take it when he said goodbye
thought she might do some cryin' lose some sleep at night
but he had no idea when he hit the road
that without him in her life she'd let herself go
let herself go on a singles cruise
to vegas once then to honolulu
let herself go to new york city
a week at the spa came back knockedout pretty
when he said he didn't love her no more
she let herself go

she poured her heart an' soul into their threebedroom ranch
spent her days raisin' babies ironin' his pants
came home one day from the grocery store and found his note
and without him there to stop her she let herself go
let herself go on her first blinddate
had the time of her life with some friends at the lake
let herself go buy a brand new car
drove down to the beach he always said was too far
sand sure felt good between her toes
she let herself go on a singles cruise
to vegas once then to honolulu
let herself go to new york city
a week at the spa came back knockedout pretty
when he said he didn't love her no more
she let herself go
to vegas once honolulu new york city
came back knockedout pretty

she's someone else's wife
and i can get on with my life
and that thrills me
she married him today
her daddy gave the bride away
i heard a tear rolled down her face
and that kills me
ëcuz now i can see why
she's finally crying
how was i supposed to know
she was slowly lettin' go
if i was puttin' her through hell
hell  i couldn't tell
she could've given me a sign
and opened up my eyes
how was i supposed to see
she never cried in front of me
yeah maybe i might've changed
it's hard for me to say
but the story's still the same
and it's a sad one
and i'll always believe
if she ever did cry for me
they were tears that you can't see
you know the bad ones
and now i can see why
she's finally crying
how was i supposed to know
she was slowly lettin' go
if i was puttin' her through hell
hell  i couldn't tell
she could've given me a sign
and opened up my eyes
how was i supposed to see
she never cried in front of me
without a doubt i know now
how it outta be
cuz she's gone and it's wrong
and it bothers me
tomorrow i'll still be asking myself
how was i supposed to know
she was slowly lettin' go
if i was puttin' her through hell
hell  i couldn't tell
she could've given me a sign
and opened up my eyes
how was i supposed to see
how was i supposed to see
she never cried in front of me
well  i couldn't tell 
written by dickey lee
she thinks i still care
just because i ask a friend about her
just because i spoke her name somewhere
just because i rang her number by mistake today
she thinks i still care
just because i haunt the same old places
where the mem'ry of her lingers ev'rywhere
just because i'm not the happy guy i used to be
she thinks i still care
but if she's happy thinkin' i still need her
then let that silly notion bring her cheer
but how could she ever be so foolish
oh where would she get such an idea
just because i ask a friend about her
just because i spoke her name somewhere
just because i saw her then went all to pieces
she thinks i still care
she thinks i still care 
plowin' these fields in the hot summer sun
over by the gate lordy here she comes
with a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
i make a little room and she climbs on up
open up her throttle and stir a little dust
just look at her faceshe ain't foolin' me
she thinks my tractor's sexy
it really turns her on
she's always starin' at me
while i'm chuggin' along
she likes the way it's pullin' while we're tillin' up the land
she's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
she's the only one who really understands what gets me
she thinks my tractor's sexy
we'll ride back and forth 'till we run outta light
take it to the barn put it up for the night

she's always starin' at me 
while i'm chuggin' along
she likes the way it pullin while we're tillin' up the land
she's even kinda crazr 'bout my farmers tan

i got my best smile on but it's no disguise
it don't hide the pain in these eyes
i did her so wrong for so long
turned my back on her love now she's long gone
i did my part to break her heart
she walked out on me and tore my world apart
she used to be mine 
oh she used to be mine
it's taken every bit of strength that i have
to keep a hurt look off of my face
i can't keep from lookin' back over my shoulder
at the lucky man takin' my place
oh if it weren't for my pride i'd probably take off runnin'
guess what i'm feelin' is what i got comin'
i did her so wrong for so long
turned my back on her love now she's long gone
i did my part to break her heart
she walked out on me and tore my world apart
she used to be mine

thought about her more thought about me less
joked to make her laugh held her when she cried
a little more of that maybe i wouldn't be
driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
calling everyone we know
stopping any place she might be
going any place she might go
beating on the dash screaming out her name at the windshield
tears soaking up my face
if i'd 'a loved her this much all along
maybe maybe yeah maybe she wouldn't be gone

said if i didn't change she was leaving

as a started sinking lower
the minute that she waltzed right through that door
not long ago i held her
like a fool i went and left her
now she's with somebody else out on that floor
and she's got the rhythm and i got the blues
and she's showing me how much i had to lose
with her every little move she's telling me i'm over you
she's got the rhythm and i got the blues
well that music's gettin' louder
as my heart keeps beatin' faster
as she spells out regret in perfect time
well i thought i wanted freedom
but that ball and chain i needed
'cause when you choose sometimes you lose the prize
and she's got the rhythm and i got the blues
and she's showing me how much i had to lose
with her every little move she's telling me i'm over you
she's got the rhythm and i got the blues
with her every little move she's telling me i'm over you

slowly softly lingers
in my ear

the world starts spinning slower

your lips so close we kiss almost
just barely touch but that's enough
to make me
shiver tremble i never

i'll bet you never heard ol' marshall dillon say
miss kitty have you ever thought of runnin' away
or settlin' down would you marry me
if i asked you twice and begged you pretty please
she'd of said yes in a new york minute
they never tied the knot his heart wasn't in it
he just stole a kiss as he rode away
he never hung his hat up at kitty's place

i should've been a cowboy
i should've learned to rope and ride
i'd be wearin' my sixshooter
ridin' my pony on the cattle drive
stealin' the young girl's hearts
just like gene and roy
singin' those camp fire songs
oh i should've been a cowboy
i might have had a sidekick with a funny name
runnin' wild through the hills chasin' jesse james
or ending up on the brink of danger
ridin' shotgun for the texas rangers
go west young man haven't you been told
california's full of whiskey women and gold
sleepin' all night beneath the desert stars
with a dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart

 
it's strange to think
the songs we used to sing
the smiles
the flowers
everything is gone
yesterday i found out about you
even though i'm just looking at you
feels wrong
you say that you'd take it all back
given one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said yes
you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby and you might still have me
you can see that i've been crying
baby you know all the right things to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same
you say that the past is the past
you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said yes
you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby and you might still have me
oh i can't resist
before you go
tell me this
was it worth it
was she worth this
no no no no no
you should have said no
you should have gone home
you should have thought twice before you let it all go
you should have known the word
that what you did with her would get to me
i should have been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no
baby and you might still have me 



don't mean to get a little forward with you don't mean to get ahead of where we are
don't mean to act a little nervous around you just a little nervous about my heart 'cause
it's been awhile since i felt this feeling that everything that you do gives me
it's been so long since somebody whispered
shut up and kiss me
didn't expect to be in this position didn't expect to have to rise above
my reputation for cynicism been a jaded lady when it comes to love but
oh baby just to feel this feeling that everything that you do gives me
it's been too long since somebody whispered
shut up and kiss me
there's something about the silent type attracting me to you
all business baby none of the hype
that no talker can live up to
come closer baby i can't hear you just another whisper if you please
don't worry 'bout the details darlin' you've got the kind of mind i love to read
talk is cheap and baby time's expensive so why waste another minute more
life's too short to be so apprehensive love's as much the symptom darlin' as the cure
oh baby when i feel this feeling it's like genuine voodoo hits me
it's been too long since somebody whispered
oh baby i can feel this feeling that everything that you do gives me
it's been too long since somebody whispered
shut up and kiss me
shut up and kiss me

in may of nineteen fortyone the war had just begun
the germans had the biggest ships
that had the biggest guns
the bismark was the fastest ship
that ever sailed the seas
on her deck were guns as big as steers
and shells as big as trees
out of the cold and foggy night
came the british ship the hood
and ev'ry british seaman he knew and understood
they had to sink the bismark the terror of the sea
stop those guns as big as steers
and those shells as big as trees
we'll find that german battleship
that's makin' such a fuss
we gotta sink the bismark
'cause the world depends on us
hit the decks arunnin' boys
and spin those guns around
when we find the bismark we gotta cut her down
the hood found the bismark and on that fatal day
the bismark started firin' fifteen miles away
we gotta sink the bismark was the battle sound
but when the smoke had cleared away
the mighty hood went down
for six long days and weary nights
they tried to find her trail
churchill told the people put ev'ry ship asail
'cause somewhere on that ocean
i know she's gotta be
we gotta sink the bismark to the bottom of the sea
we'll find that german battleship
that's makin' such a fuss
we gotta sink the bismark
'cause the world depends on us
hit the decks arunnin' boys
and spin those guns around
when we find the bismark we gotta cut her down
the fog was gone the seventh day
and they saw the mornin' sun
ten hours away from homeland
the bismark made its run
the admiral of the british fleet said
turn those bows around
we found that german battleship
and we're gonna cut her down
the british guns were aimed
and the shells were comin' fast
the first shell hit the bismark
they knew she couldn't last
that mighty german battleship is just a memory
sink the bismark was the battle cry
that shook the seven seas
we found that german battleship
was makin' such a fuss
we had to sink the bismark
'cause the world depends on us
we hit the deck arunnin' and
we spun those guns around
we found the mighty bismark
and then we cut her down
we found that german battleship
was makin' such a fuss
we had to sink the bismark
'cause the world depends on us
we hit the deck arunnin' and
we spun those guns around
we found the mighty bismark
and then we cut her down 
why did she have to go 
so young i just don't know why 
things happen half the time 
without reason without rhyme
lovely sweet young woman
daughter wife and mother
makes no sense to me
i just have to believe
she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waiting
and i know she's smiling saying
don't worry 'bout me
loved ones she left behind
just trying to survive 
and understand the why
feeling so lost inside
anger shot straight at god
then asking for his love
empty with disbelief 
just hoping that maybe
she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waiting
and i know she's smiling saying
don't worry 'bout me
it's hard to say goodbye
her picture in my mind
will always be of times i'll cherish
and i won't cry 'cause
she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waiting
and i know she's smiling saying
don't worry 'bout me
don't worry 'bout me
don't worry 'bout me 
i'm waiting on the green light to make you mine
but your heart's just taking it's own sweet time

i'm betting it's only a matter of time
before you and me are standing at the finish line
you're having your doubts
but you'll come around

you're playin' it safe
but baby i'll wait

sarabeth is scared to death
to hear what the doctor will say
she hasn't been well since the day that she fell
and the bruise it just won't go away
so she sits and she waits with her mother and dad
and flips through an old magazine
till the nurse with the smile stands in the door
and says will you please come with me
sarabeth is scared to death
'cause the doctor just told her the news
between the red cells and white something's not right
but we're gonna take care of you
six chances in ten it won't come back again
with the therapy we're gonna try
it's just been approved it's the strongest there is
and i think that we caught it in time
and sarabeth closes her eyes
and she dreams she's dancing
around and around without any cares
and her very first love is holding her close
and a soft wind is blowing her hair
sarabeth is scared to death
as she sits holding her mom
'cause it would be a mistake for someone to take
a bald headed girl to the prom
for just this morning right here on her pillow
was the cruelest of any surprise
and she cried when she gathered it all in her hands
the proof that she couldn't deny
and sarabeth closes her eyes
and she dreams she's dancing
around and around without any cares
and her very first love is holding her close
and a soft wind is blowing her hair
it's quarter to seven that boy's at the door
and her daddy ushers him in
and when he takes off his cap
they all start to cry
'cause this morning where his hair had all been
softly she touches just skin
and they go dancing around and around
without any cares
and her very first true love is holding her close
and for a moment she isn't scared 


there's an elvis movie on the marquee sign
we've all seen at least three times
everybody's broke bobby's got a buck
put a dollars worth of gas in his pickup truck
we're going' ninety miles an hour down a dead end road
what's the hurry son where you gonna go
we're gonna howl at the moon shoot out the light
it's a small town saturday night
it's a small town saturday night
lucy's got her lipstick on a little too bright
bobby's gettin' drunk and lookin' for a fight
liquor on his breath and trouble on his mind
and lucy's just a kid along for the ride
got a sixpack of beer and a bottle of wine
gotta be bad just to have a good time
they're gonna howl at the moon shoot out the light
it's a small town saturday night
it's a small town saturday night
bobby told lucy the world ain't round
drops off sharp at the edge of town
lucy you know the world must be flat
'cause when people leave town they never come back
they go ninety miles an hour to the city limits sign
put the pedal to the metal 'fore they change their mind
they howl at the moon shoot out the light
it's a small town saturday night
they howl at the moon shoot out the light
yeah it's a small town saturday night
it's a small town saturday night
it's a small town saturday night 
born the middle son of a farmer
and a small town southern man
like his daddy's daddy before him
brought up workin' on the land
fell in love with a small town woman
and they married up and settled down
natural way of life if you're lucky
for a small town southern man
first there came four pretty daughters
for this small town southern man
then a few years later came another
a boy he wasn't planned
seven people livin' all together
in a house built with his own hands
little words with love and understandin'
from a small town southern man

and he bowed his head to jesus
and he stood for uncle sam
and he only loved one woman
he was always proud of what he had
he said his greatest contribution
is the ones you leave behind
raised on the ways and gentle kindness
of a small town southern man
raised on the ways and gentle kindness
of a small town southern man
callous hands told the story
for this small town southern man
he gave it all to keep it all together
and keep his family on his land
like his daddy years wore out his body
made it hard just to walk and stand
you can break the back
but you can't break the spirit
of a small town southern man

finally death came callin'
for this small town southern man
he said it's alright 'cause i see angels
and they got me by the hand
don't you cry and don't you worry
i'm blessed and i know i am
'cause god has a place in heaven
for a small town southern man
 



well i won't make you tell me
what i've come to understand
you're a certain kind of woman and 
i'm a different kind of man
i've tried to make you love me
you're tried to find a spark of the flame that burned and
somehow turned to smoke ring in the dark
the loneliness within me
takes a heavy toll
'cause it burns as slow as whiskey through an empty aching soul and
the night is like a dagger
long and cold and sharp
as i sit here on the front steps
blowing smoke rings in the dark
i i i know i must be going
'cause loves already gone and
all i'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart and 
all i'll leave are smoke rings in the dark
the rain falls where it wants to
wind blows where it will
everything on earth goes somewhere
but i swear we're standin' still
so i'm not going to wake you
i'll go easy on your heart
i'll just touch your face and drift away
like smoke rings in the dark
i i i know i must be going
'cause loves already gone and
all i'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart and 
all i'll leave are smoke rings in the dark 
beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
the unborn grass lies waiting 
for its coat to turn to green
the snowbird sings the song he always sings
and speaks to me of flowers 
that will bloom again in spring
when i was young 
my heart was young then too
anything that it would tell me 
that's the thing that i would do
but now i feel such emptiness within
for the thing that i want most in life's 
the thing that i can't win
spread your tiny wings and fly away
and take the snow back with you
where it came from on that day
the one i love forever is untrue
and if i could you know that i would
fly away with you
the breeze along the river seems to say
that he'll only break my heart again 
should i decide to stay
so little snowbird
take me with you when you go
to that land of gentle breezes 
where the peaceful waters flow
spread your tiny wings and fly away
and take the snow back with you
where it came from on that day
the one i love forever is untrue
and if i could you know that i would
fly away with you
yeah if i could i know that i would 
flyyyy away with you 
it's wintertime and the weather's fine 
the snow on the woods and fields when i reveal my snowmobile
thrill by thrill by golly n' hill 
baby it'll make ya feel like an outdoor meal
on a snowmobile
up
listen to the sound when the belts go round '
when the winter carnival's here
and oh what fun at the crack of the gun 
when the whole gang disappears
verse
the race is on from the bush to the pond
and back where the judges's feel you've won their seal
for the snowmobile
you've won their seal for the snowmobile
where skier's ski and skater's pee and snowshoes lend appeal
like a bogie wheel on a snowmobile
we tip the glass to the northern lass for she won't let ya kneel
she'd rather squeal on a snowmobile
up
you're off to the town where the word goes round 
it's winter carnival time
in goggles boots and a snowproof suit your sweethearts on your mind
ya win the race and you see her face and you know that she must feel
you've got a real good snowmobile repeat
now down the street u can hear the beat  the clickin of the dancer's heel
when the fiddler's peel off a ragtime reel
you dance and tear with an i don't care
on the way back home you'll wheelover hill and field on a snowmobile 
up
through the golden glow on powdered snow 
when the moon comes rolling along
on a homeward trail u can hear the wail of the whole gang singing a song
if tomorrow's clear with fishin gear 
we'll head for a lake trout meal with a rod and a reeland a snowmobile
life can be real with a snowmobile there ain't no deal like a snowmobile 
you could've kissed me like this wasnt gonna last
kept me from saying something i'll never take back
you could have held me like there was no chance
of me waking up where i am
you could have stop short of every dream i've ever had

so help me girl
you've gone too far 
its way too late 
to save my heart
the way it feels
each time we touch 
i know ive never been so loved
and i can't help myself
so help me girl
you had to be there when that old sun came up
makin last night feel like a vision of things yet to come
you just had to hold me like nobody else
now look what you've gone and done
you had to love me till i couldnt get enough

2x
now i cant help myself so help me girl 
yeah yeah
what you got if you ain't got love
the kind that you just want to give away
it's ok to open up
go ahead and let the light shine through
i know it's hard on a rainy day
you wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
but don't run out on your faith
cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
is just a grain of sand
and what you've been out there searching for forever
is in your hands
and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
it sure makes everything else seem
so small
it's so easy to get lost inside
a problem that seems so big at the time
it's like a river that's so wide it swallows you whole
while you're sitting around thinking about what you can't change
and worrying about all the wrong things
time's flying by moving so fast
you better make it count cause you can't get it back 
sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
is just a grain of sand
and what you've been out there searching for forever
is in your hands
oh and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
it sure makes everything else seem 
so small yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
is just a grain of sand
and what you've out there searching for forever
is in your hands
and then you figure out love is all that matters after all
it sure makes everything else
oh it sure makes everything else seem
so small
yeah yeah

his old man was a rebel yeller
bad boy to the bone
he'd say can't trust that other feller
he'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin
he was raised to think like his dad
narrow mind full of hate
on the road to nowhere fast
till the grace of god got in the way
then he saw the light and hit his knees 
and cried and said a prayer
rose up a brand new man
left the old one right there
here's to the strong
thanks to the brave
don't give up hope
some people change
against all odds
against the grain
love finds a way
some people change
she was born with her mother's habit
you could say it's in her blood
she hates that she's gotta have it
as she fills her glass up
she'd love to kill that bottle
but all she can think about
is a better life a second chance
and everyone she's letting down
she throws that bottle down
here's to the strong
thanks to the brave
don't give up hope
some people change
against all odds
against the grain
love finds a way
some people change
thank god for those who make it
let them be the light
let them be the light
some people change
here's to the strong
thanks to the brave
don't give up hope
some people change
against all odds
against the grain
love finds a way
some people change
some people change

to know you inside out

'cause somebody knows you now 


on a postcard by a glass of wine
in a small cafe just outside of paris
by a rope swing danglin in the breeze
carved in the bark of a dogwood tree in kansas
someone took a chance
someone let it show
someone had to get it out and let somebody know
somebody wrote love in a permanent way
somebody wrote love and the world was changed
just a simple word but it can do so much
in a space where nothing was
somebody wrote love
somebody wrote love
with a red crayon on a notebook sheet
spelled out with a backwards e in first grade
on a overpass out side of town
a heart's spray painted around two names
someone took a chance
someone let it show
since i met you girl i want the world to know
somebody wrote love in a permanent way
somebody wrote love and the world was changed
just a simple word but it can do so much
in a space where nothing was
somebody wrote love
in the way that you love me
in the things that you do
when you first took hold of me baby that's when i knew
somebody wrote love in a permanent way
somebody wrote love and my world was changed
just a simple word but it can do so much
in a space where nothing was
somebody wrote love
somebody wrote love 

she's never pulled anybody from a burning building
she's never rocked central park to a half a million fans screaming out her name
she's never hit a shot to win the game
she's never left her footprints on the moon
she's never made a solo hot air balloon ride around the world
no she's just your everyday average girl but
she's somebody's hero
a hero to her baby with a skinnedup knee
a little kiss is all she needs
the keeper of the cheerios
the voice that brings snow white to life
bedtime stories every night
and that smile lets her know
she's somebody's hero
she didn't get a check every week like a ninetofiver
but she's been a waiter and a cook and a taxi driver
for twenty years there at home
until the day her girl was grown
giving all her love to her was her life's ambition
but now her baby's movin' on and she'll soon be missin' her
but not today
those are tears of joy runnin' down her face
she's somebody's hero
a hero to her daughter in her wedding dress
she gave her wings to leave the nest
it hurts to let her baby go down the aisle
she walks right by
looks back into her mother's eyes
and that smile lets her know
she's somebody's hero
thirty years have flown right past
her daughter's starin' at all the photographs
of her mother
and she wishes she could be like that
oh but she already is
she's somebody's hero
a hero to her mother in a rockin' chair
she runs a brush through her silver hair
the envy of the nursing home
she drops by every afternoon
feeds her mama with a spoon
and that smile lets her know
her mother's smile lets her know
she's somebody's hero 


there is somebody i'm longing to see i hope that she turns out to be
someone who'll watch over me
i'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood i know i could always be good
to one who'll watch over me
although she may not be the girl some men think of
as pretty to my heart she carries the key
won't you tell her please to put on some speed follow my lead
oh how i need someone to watch over me
 guitar 
although she may not be
someone to watch over me 

i'm looking for something in red
something that's shocking to turn someone's head
strapless and sequined and cut down to there
stockings and garters and lace underwear
the guaranteed number to knock the man dead
i'm looking for something in red
i'm looking for something in green
something to outdo an exhigh school queen
jealousy comes in the color of jade
do you have some pumps and a purse in this shade
and a perfume that whispers please come back to me
i'm looking for something in green
i'm looking for something in white
something that shimmers in soft candlelight
everyone calls us the most perfect pair
should i wear a veil or a rose in my hair
well the train must be long and the waist must be tight
i'm looking for something in white
i'm looking for something in blue
something real tiny the baby's brand new
he has his father's nose and his chin
we once were hot lovers now we're more like friends
don't tell me that just what old married folk do
i'm looking for something in blue
i'm looking for something in red
like the one that i wore when i first turned his head
strapless and sequined and cut down to there
just a size larger than i wore last year
the guaranteed number to knock the man dead
i'm looking for something
i've gotta have something
i'm looking for something in red 
it was labor day weekend i was seventeen
i bought a coke and some gasoline
and i drove out to the county fair
when i saw her for the first time
she was standing there in the ticket line
and it all started right then and there
oh a sailor sky made a perfect sunset
and that's the day i'll never forget
i had a barbeque stain on my white tshirt
she was killing me in that miniskirt
skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
she had a suntan line and red lipstick
i worked so hard for that first kiss
and a heart don't forget something like that
well it was five years later on a southbound plane
i was headed down to new orleans
to meet some friends of mine for the mardi gras
when i heard a voice from the past
comin' from a few rows back
and when i looked i couldn't believe just what i saw
she said i bet you don't remember me
and i said only every other memory
i had a barbeque stain on my white tshirt
you were killing me in that miniskirt
skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
you had a suntan line and red lipstick
i worked so hard for that first kiss
and a heart don't forget something like that
like an old photograph
time can make a feeling fade
but the memory of a first love
never fades away
i had a barbeque stain on my white tshirt
she was killing me in that miniskirt
skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
she had a sun tan line and red lipstick
i worked so hard for that first kiss
a heart don't forget no a heart don't forget
i said a heart don't forget something like that
oh not something like that 
monday hard to wake up
fill my coffee cup i'm out the door
yeah the freeway's standing still today
it's gonna make me late and that's for sure
i'm running out of gas and out of time
never gonna make it there by nine

there's gotta be something more
gotta be more than this
i need a little less hard time
i need a little more bliss
i'm gonna take my chances
taking a chance i might
find what i'm looking for
there's gotta be something more
five years and there's no doubt
that i'm burnt out i've had enough
so now boss man here's my two weeks
i'll make it short and sweet so listen up
i could work my life away but why
i got things to do before die

some believe in destiny and some believe in fate
i believe that happiness is something we create
you best believe that i'm not gonna wait
'cause there's gotta be something more
i get home 730 the house is dirty but it can wait
yeah 'cause right now i need some downtime
to drink some red wine and celebrate
armageddon could be knocking at my door 
but i ain't gonna answer that's for sure
there's gotta be something more 
there's a story that my daddy tells religiously
like clockwork every time he see's an opening
in a conversation 
bout the way things use to be
i just roll my eyes and make a bline for the door
i'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor
hanging onto every word 
man the things i heard
it was harder times and longer days
five miles to school uphill both ways
we were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor
course that was back before the war
yea your uncle and i made quit a pair
flying f15's through hostile air
he went down but they missed me by a hair
he'd always stop right there and say
that's something to be proud of
that's a life you can hang your hat on
as your chins held high as the tears fall down
gut sucked in chest stuck out
like a small town flag a flying
or a new born baby crying
in the arms of the woman that you love
that's something to be proud of
son graduatin college that was momma's dream
and i was on my way to anywhere else when i turned eighteen
that's when you got a fast car and think you got everything
i learned real quick those gto's don't run off faith
i ended up broke down in some town north of la
working maximum hours for minimum wage
i fell in love next thing i know
babies came and the car got sold
sure do miss that old hot rod
but you sure save gas in them foreign jobs
dad i wonder if i ever let you down
if you're ashamed how i turned out
well he lowered his voice then he raised his brow
said let me tell you right now
that's something to be proud of
that's a life you can hang your hat on
no need to make a million just be thankful to be working
if you're doing what you're able
putting food there on the table
and providing for the family that you love
that's something to be proud of
and if all you ever really do is the best you can
well you did it man
that's something to be proud of
that's a life you can hang your hat on
as your chins held high as the tears fall down
gut sucked in chest stuck out
like a small town flag a flying
or a new born baby crying
in the arms of the woman that you love
that's something to be proud of
that's something to be proud of
that's something to be proud of
that's something to be proud of

if you see her out tonight
and she tells you that it's just the lights
that bring her here and not her loneliness
that's what she says but sometimes she forgets

she's had all the comfort she can stand
you best believe every word she says
but don't give up 'cause sometimes she forgets
and sometimes she forgets that not too long ago she swore

and sometimes she forgets that not too long ago she swore
she wasn't gonna let her heart be broken anymore
if you see her out tonight
and she tells you that it's just the lights
that bring her here and not her loneliness
that's what she says but sometimes she forgets
yeah that's what she says but sometimes she forgets
so don't you dare give up 'cause sometimes she forgets 



billy ray was a preacher's son
an' when his daddy'd visit he'd come along
when they gathered around and started talkin'
oh that's when billy'd take me walkin'
out through the back yard we'd go walkin'
an' then he'd look into my eyes lord knows to my surprise 
the only one who could ever reach me
was the son of a preacherman
the only boy who could ever teach me
was the son of a preacherman
yes he was he was oh yes he was
ooh 
oh bein' good isn't always easy
no matter how hard i try
when he started sweettalkin' to me
he'd come 'n tell me everything is all right
he'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
can i get away again tonight 
the only one who could ever reach me
was the son of a preacherman
the only boy who could ever teach me
was the son of a preacherman
yes he was oh yes he was
how well i remember the look that was in his eyes
stealin' kisses from me on the sly
takin' time to make time
tellin' me that he's all mine
learnin' from each other's knowin'
lookin' to see how much we've grown 
and the only one who could ever reach me
was the son of a preacherman
the only boy who could ever teach me
was the son of a preacherman
yes he was he was oh yes he was
he was he was 
the only one who could ever reach me
that sweettalkin' son of a preacherman

i was standing at the counter
i was waiting for the change
when i heard that old familiar music start
it was like a lighted match
had been tossed into my soul 
it was like a dam had broken in my heart
after taking every detour
gettin' lost and losing track
so that even if i wanted i could not find my way back
after driving out the memory of the way things might have been
after i'd forgotten all about us
the song remembers when
we were rolling through the rockies
we were up above the clouds
when a station out of jackson played that song
and it seemed to fit the moment
and the moment seemed to freeze
when we turned the music up and sang along
and there was a god in heaven
and the world made perfect sense
we were young and were in love and we were easy to convince
we were headed straight for eden
it was just around the bend
and though i had forgotten all about it
the song remembers when
i guess something must've happened
and we must've said goodbye
and my heart must have been broken
though i can't recall just why
the song remembers when
well for all the miles between us
and for all the time that's passed
you would think i haven't gotten very far
and i hope my hasty heart
will forgive me just this once
if i stop to wonder how on earth you are
but that's just a lot of water
underneath a bridge i've burned
and there's no use in back tracking around corners i have turned
still i guess some things we bury
are just bound to rise again
and even if the whole world had forgotten
the song remembers when 
i met a guy on the red eye
he spotted my guitar
and said what do you do
i said i sing for a living
country music mixed with
a little rock and a little blues
he said i'm sorry
but i've never been crazy
'bout that twang and trains and hillbilly thing
what ever made you want to sing stuff like that
i just looked at him and laughed and said
cause it's songs about me
and who i am
songs about loving and living
and good hearted women and family and god
yeah they're all just
songs about me
songs about me
so i offered him tickets
i said you'll see what i mean
if you show up tonight
he said i doubt you'll change my opinion
i'll be kind of busy but hey man i'll try
then later on when we finished our songs
about scars and cars and broken hearts
i saw him he was standing there
right next to the stage
and he shouted
man you were right
it was like you sang those
songs about me
and who i am
songs about loving and living
and good hearted women and family and god
yeah they're all just
songs about me
songs about me
so i'll just keep on singing
'til i hear the whole world singing those
songs about me
and who i am
songs about loving and living
and good hearted women and family and god
yeah they're all just
songs about me
songs about me 
you'll be sorry you asked me the reason
that she's not here with me tonight
and i know you were probably just acting polite
you'll be sorry you ever asked why
we started having problems in august last year
some things have been kind of rough for quite a while
and you know how you think it'll work itself out
yeah but mister that thoughts wrong by a long long mile
you'll be sorry you asked me the reason
that she's not here with me tonight
and i know you were probably just acting polite
you'll be sorry you ever asked why
i might should have seen we were drifting apart
but i was in what i guess you'd call denial
and i had always heard you were the last one to know
hey well buddy i was last by a long long while
you'll be sorry you asked me the reason
that she's not here with me tonight
and i know you were probably just acting polite
but you'll be sorry you ever asked why
ok we both have a tendency to overreact
so i can't really tell you who's at fault
there was certain third parties
well her sister for one
helped bring our reconciling to a drop dead halt
aren't you sorry you asked me the reason
why she's not here with me tonight
and i know you were probably just acting polite
but i'm sure sorry you ever asked why
aren't you sorry you ever asked why
i'm sure sorry you ever asked why
did i tell you how she tried to have me locked out of the house
had to go hire a lawyer and all
but i know that was mostly her family's idea
i could hear them tell her what to say every time i'd call
fade out
you'll you sorry you asked me the reason
that she's not here with me tonight
and i know you were probably just acting polite
but i'm sure sorry you ever asked why
aren't you sorry you ever asked why 

southern nights
have you ever felt a southern night
free as a breeze not to mention the trees
whistling tunes that you know and love so
southern nights
just as good even when you close your eyes
i apologize to anyone who can truly say
that he has found a better way
southern skies
have you ever noticed southern skies
it's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
it goes running through your soul
like the stories of old
old man he and his dog
they walk the old land
every flower touched his cold hand
as he slowly walked by
weeping willows would cry for joy joy
feel so good feel so good it's frightening
wish i could stop this world from fighting
la da da da da
mysteries like this and
many others in the trees
blow in the night in the southern skies
southern nights
they feel so good it's frightening
wish i could stop this world from fighting
la da da da da

when the night has come
and our land is dark
and the moon is the only light we'll see
no i won't be afraid no i won't be afraid
just as long just as long as you stand by me
darlin' stand by me 
won't you stand by me
you'll be needed to stand by me
and if the sky we look upon
should tumble and fall
and the mountains should fall to the sea
no i won't be afraid no i won't be afraid
just as long just as long as you stand by me
darlin' stand by me 
won't you stand by me
you'll be needed stand by me
  
darlin' stand by me 
won't you stand by me
you'll be needed stand by me
darlin' stand by me 
won't you stand by me
you'll be needed stand stand by me 
sometimes it's hard to be a woman
giving all your love to just one man
you'll have bad times and he'll have good times
doin' things that you don't understand
but if you love him you'll forgive him
even though he's hard to understand
and if you love him oh be proud of him
'cause after all he's just a man
stand by your man give him two arms to cling to
and something warm to come to
when nights are cold and lonely
stand by your man and show the world you love him
keep giving all the love you can
stand by your man
stand by your man and show the world you love him
keep giving all the love you can
stand by your man 

we call them cool
those hearts who have no scars to show
the ones that never do let go
and risk the tables being turned
we call them fools
who have to dance within the flames
who chance the sorrow and the shame
that always comes with getting burned
but you got to be tough when consumed by desire
cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire
we call them strong
those who can face this world alone
who seem to get by on their own
those who will never take the fall
we call them weak
who are unable to resist
the slightest chance love might exsist
and for that forsake it all
they're so hellbent on giving
walking a wire
convinced it's not living
if you stand outside the fire

standing outside the fire
standing outside the fire
life is not tried it is merely survived
if you're standing outside the fire
there's this love that is burning
deep in my soul constantly yearning to get out of control
wanting to glide higher and higher
i can't abide standing outside the fire
 twice 
you feel like a candle in a hurricane
just like a picture with a broken frame
alone and helpless
like you've lost your fight
but you'll be all right
but you'll be all right
'cause when push
comes to shove
you taste what you're made of
you might bend
till you break
'cause it's all you can take
on your knees
you look up
decide you've had enough
you get mad
you get strong
wipe your hands
shake it off
then you stand
then you stand
life's like a novel
with the end ripped out
the edge of a canyon
with only one way down
take what you're given
before it's gone
start holding on
keep holding on
'cause when push
comes to shove
you taste what you're made of
you might bend
till you break
'cause it's all you can take
on your knees
you look up
decide you've had enough
you get mad
you get strong
wipe your hands
shake it off
then you stand
then you stand
every time you get up
and get back in the race
one more small piece of you
starts to fall into place
'cause when push
comes to shove
you taste what you're made of
you might bend
till you break
'cause it's all you can take
on your knees
you look up
decide you've had enough
you get mad
you get strong
wipe your hands
shake it off
then you stand
then you stand
then you stand
then you stand
yeah then you stand
then you stand
then you stand 
feat keith urban
i never was a straightlace straight a student
teacher's pet or child prodigy
i wasn't gonna get rich throwin' a football
it take too long to get a law degree
so i sat down with momma and daddy
tried to talk some sense into my big head
but the best advice that i ever got
was from my sister's rock star boyfriend
just get you a guitar and learn how to play
cut up some jeans come up with a name
when you're living in a world that you dont understand
find a few good buddies start a band
start a band start a band
and all those girls that were too cool to talk to
they'll be waiting in the line out back
might get your picture in the hometown paper
maybe buy your momma that cadillac
just get you a guitar and learn how to play
cut up some jeans come up with a name
when you're living in a world that you don't understand
find a few good buddies start a band
start a band scrape up some money buy a van
learn free bird and ramblin' man
never buy another beer again
guitar
just get you a guitar and learn how to play
grow out your hair come up with a name
with a little bit of luck you'll be packing the stands
find a few good buddies start a band
no need to study start a band
call up some buddies man start a band 
it's a long way from la to denver
it's a long time to hang in the sky
it's a long way home to starwood in aspen
my sweet rocky mountain paradise
oh my sweet rocky mountain paradise
springtime is rollin' round slowly
gray skies are bringin' me down
i can't remember when i've ever been so lonely 
i forgot what it's like to be home
can't remember what it's like to be home
i think on my lady's sweet memories
i think on my children sweet smiles
i think on my home in starwood in aspen
all my friends and the snow covered hills
oh my friends are the snow covered hills
can i tell you i'm happy to be here
to share and consider this time
for i see here the shadows of changes
and a feeling of new friends to find
and i see here some new friends to find
it's a long way from this place to denver
it's a long time to hang in the sky
it's a long way home to starwood in aspen
a sweet rocky moutnain paradise
oh my sweet rocky mountain paradise 
got a big leather suitcase all i own's inside
seems i've been walkin' for days can't even bum a ride
try steppin' to a tune with the rhythm of a walkin' man
mind drifts like a big balloon out of my situation at hand
ain't it funny how a melody can bring back a memory
take you to another place in time
completely change your state of mind
walkin' down a lonely highway not feelin' alone
thinkin' back when things went my way and not the road i'm on
well i've been down a time or two but it never lasted long
i can always make it through on a wing and a prayer and a song
ain't it funny how a melody can bring back a memory
take you to another place in time
completely change your state of mind
it can make a right from a wrong it can make you fall in love
it can get you singin' along
chase the clouds away and make the sun shine above
a melody can bring back a memory
take you to another place in time
completely change your state of mind
a melody can bring back a memory
take you to another place in time
completely change your state of mind 
maybe i pray too much maybe i'm wastin god's time
livin without your touch is driving me out of my mind
if you could only see how much you matter to me
maybe you would stay forever
maybe i care too much maybe i'll push you away
maybe i'd have my doubts if i were in your place
and if you could see inside this achin heart of mine
maybe you would stay forever
you don't have to go on livin
with your back against the wall
let my lovin arms surround you
i won't let you fall
and if you would trust in me and this love of mine
we'll sail an endless sea under a starry sky
and when the cold wind blows we'll hold each other close
maybe you will stay forever
and when the cold wind blows we'll hold each other close
baby you will stay forever 
baby the clock on the wall is lying
it's not really that late
it's too cold outside to be walking around the streets of this town
and wherever you think you have to be can wait

why don't you stay with me
share all your secrets tonight 
we can make believe the morning sun never will rise
come and lay your head on this big brass bed
and we'll be alright as long as you stay with me yeah
baby there's just no use in hiding
the way that i'm feeling right now
with you standing there baby i swear i can't help but stare
girl you're wearing me out wearing me out

baby stay with me
share all your secrets tonight 
we can make believe the morning sun never will rise
come and lay your head on this big brass bed
and we'll be alright as long as you stay with me
baby don't go
it looks like it's starting to rain
and it's so warm here in this apartment wrapped up in this blanket so
stay

stay with me
share all your secrets tonight 
we can make believe the morning sun never will rise
come and lay your head on this big brass bed
and we'll be alright as long as you stay
i'll be alright as long as you stay
with me yeah
stay with me 


i've been sittin' here stairin' at the clock on the wall
and i've been layin' here prayin'
prayin' she won't call
it's just another call from home and you'll get it and be gone and i'll be cryin'
and i'll be beggin' you baby
beg you not to leave
but i'll be left here waitin'
my heart on my sleeve
oh for the next time we'll be here seems like a million years and i think i'm dyin'
what do i have to do to make you see
she can't love you like me
why don't you stay
i'm down on my knees
i'm so tired of bein' lonely
don't i give you what you need
when she calls you to go
there is one thing you should know
we don't have to live this way
baby why don't you stay
you keep tellin' me baby
there will come a time
when you will leave her arms
and forever be in mine
but i don't think that's the truth
and i don't like bein' used and i'm tired of waitin'
it's too much pain to have to bare
to love a man you have to share
why don't you stay
i'm down on my knees
i'm so tired of bein' lonely
don't i give you what you need
when she calls you to go
there is one thing you should know
we don't have to live this way
baby why don't you stay
i can't take it any longer but my will is gettin' stronger
and i think i know just what i have to do
i can't waste another minute
after all that i've put in it
i've given you my best
why does she get the best of you
so next time you find you wanna leave her bed for mine
why don't you stay
i'm up off my knees
i'm so tired of bein' lonely
you can't give me what i need
when she begs you not to go
there is one thing you should know
i don't have to live this way
baby why don't you stay 
she was the love of my life
back in '95
we hardly spent a day or night apart
we were victims of a lonely heart
and i remember that day
it all went away
yeah when i think about it even now
i find a reason to smile somehow

'cause i've still got yesterday
runnin' wild
yesterday when i close my eyes
i drift away
back where i come from
and today might not be fair
and tomorrow may not be there
but i've still got yesterday
zach was the one to hang around
we all used to drive through town
with the girls in his daddy's car
said he was gonna be a big league star
but it was rainy one night
and he didn't see the red light
now there's a stone where he used to be
and everybody cries but me

i've heard people say
you learn the future by the past
if it's any indication
then i'm looking back
'cause i've still got yesterday
runnin' wild
yesterday when i close my eyes
i drift away
back where i come from
yesterday when we had our dreams
yesterday loud and free
i steal away and i find that summer sun
today may not be fair
and tomorrow may not be there
but i've still got yesterday
runnin' wild

he was working through college on my grandpa's farm
i was thirsting for for knowledge and he had a car
i was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
when one restless summer we found love growing wild
on the banks of the river on a well beaten path
funny how those memories they last
like strawberry wine and seventeen
the hot july moon saw everything
my first taste of love oh bittersweet
green on the vine
like strawberry wine
i still remember when thirty was old
my biggest fear was september when he had to go
a few cards and letters and one long distance call
we drifted away like the leaves in the fall
but year after year i come back to this place
just to remember the taste
of strawberry wine and seventeen
the hot july moon saw everything
my first taste of love oh bittersweet
green on the vine
like strawberry wine
the fields have grown over now
years since they've seen a plow
there's nothing time hasn't touched
is it really him or the loss of my innocence
i've been missing so much
like strawberry wine and seventeen
the hot july moon saw everything
my first taste of love oh bittersweet
green on the vine
like strawberry wine 
i came here looking for something
i couldn't find anywhere else
hey i'm not trying to be nobody
i just want a chance to be myself
i've spent a thousand miles athumbin'
yes i've worn blisters on my heels
trying to find me something better
here on the streets of bakersfield
hey you don't know me but you don't like me
you say you care less how i feel
but how many of you that sit and judge me
ever walked the streets of bakersfield
spent sometime in san francisco
i spent a night there in the can
they threw this drunk man in my jail cell
i took fifteen dollars from that man
left him my watch and my old house key
don't want folks thinkin' that i'd steal
then i thanked him as i was leaving
and i headed out for bakersfield
hey you don't know me but you don't like me
you say you care less how i feel
but how many of you that sit and judge me
ever walked the streets of bakersfield
hey you don't know me but you don't like me
you say you care less how i feel
but how many of you that sit and judge me
ever walked the streets of bakersfield
how many of you that sit and judge me
ever walked the streets of bakersfield 


well she was precious like a flower
she grew wild wild but innocent
a perfect prayer in a desperate hour
she was everything beautiful and different
stupid boy you can't fence that in
stupid boy it's like holding back the wind
she laid her heart and soul right in your hands
and you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
she never even knew she had a choice
and that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
stupid boy
stupid boy
so what made you think that you could take a life
and just push it push it around
i guess to build yourself up so high
you had to take her and break her down
well she laid her heart and soul right in your hands
and you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
she never even knew she had a choice
and that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't 
you stupid boy
you always had to be right
and now you've lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive
ohhhhhh yeah yeah
well she laid her heart and soul right in your hands yeah
and you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans yes you did
she never even knew she had a choice
and that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
you stupid boy
oh i'm the same old same old stupid boy
it took awhile for her to figure out she could run
but when she did she was long gone long gone
oh she's gone
she's long gone
yeah she is
oh no one's ever gonna love me like she loved me
she loved me she loved me
god please just let her know i'm sorry
i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry baby

you ain't seen in a while
and can't help but smile
and it's two bare feet on the dashboard
young love and an old ford
cheap shades and a tattoo
and a yoohoo bottle on the floorboard
perfect song on the radio
sing along 'cause it's one we know
it's a smile it's a kiss
it's a sip of wine it's summertime
sweet summertime
temperature says 93
down at the deposit and guarantee
but that swimmin' hole
it's nice and cold
bikini bottoms underneath
but the boys' hearts still skip a beat
when them girls shimmy off
them old cutoffs
and it's two bare feet on the dashboard
young love and an old ford
cheap shades and a tattoo
and a yoohoo bottle on the floorboard
perfect song on the radio
sing along 'cause it's one we know
it's a smile it's a kiss
it's a sip of wine it's summertime
sweet summertime

and a yoohoo bottle rollin' on the floorboard
perfect song on the radio

i can see her lying back in her satin dress
in a room where you do what you don't confess
sundown you better take care
if i find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
sundown you better take care
if i find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
she's been looking like a queen in a sailor's dream
and she don't always say what she really means
sometimes i think it's a shame
when i get feeling better when i'm feeling no pain
sometimes i think it's a shame
when i get feeling better when i'm feeling no pain
i can picture every move that a man could make
getting lost in her loving is your first mistake
sundown you better take care
if i find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
sometimes i think it's a sin
when i feel like i'm winning when i'm losing again
i can see her looking fast in her faded jeans
she's a hard loving woman got me feeling mean
sometimes i think it's a shame
when i get feeling better when i'm feeling no pain
sundown you better take care
if i find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
sundown you better take care
if i find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
sometimes i think it's a sin
when i feel like i'm winning when i'm losing again

i'm so glad that i met you baby
and i'm so proud when we walk in the room
and i know it's crazy to worry like i do
but i get this feelin' that i'm losing you

i get these suspicions
even though i know that you love me baby
and i really shouldn't feel this way
suspicions
i can't help it you're just so good lookin'
i'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
when i go out to a party with you
you always turn every head in the room
and i just know what's on every man's mind
i try to fight it but it gets me sometimes


ooh suspicions
when i'm with you i feel so satisfied
the way you touch me when you lay by my side
and that look in your eyes when we make love
makes me hate myself for what i'm thinkin' of

suspicions
even though i know that you love me baby
and i really shouldn't feel this way
suspicions
i can't help it you're just so good lookin'
i'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
suspicions
even though i know that you love me baby
and i really shouldn't feel this way

with suspicious minds
and we can't build our dreams
on suspicious minds

drops by to say hello
would i still see suspicion in your eyes
here we go again
asking where i've been
can't you see these tears are real
i'm crying
we can't go on together
with suspicious minds
and we can't build our dreams
on suspicious minds
oh let our love survive
i'll dry the tears from your eyes

sweet dreams of you
every night i go thru
why can't i forget you and start my life anew
instead of having sweet dreams about you
you don't love me it's plain
i should know i'll never wear your ring
i should hate you the whole night thru
instead of having sweet dreams about you
sweet dreams of you
things i know can't come true
why can't i forget the past start loving someone new
instead of having sweet dreams about you

one wants a maid one needs his mother
they either want space or they wanna smother me
and my poor o' heart needs somebody who
can take it like a man steady and strong
not a lot of fuss and carrying on
true to a promise i can write in stone

and every little thing that a girl dreams of
someone wise enough to understand
if you want this woman's heart
take it like a man
i met somebody the other night 
started thinking he was mr right wrong
i might have never known
if a friend hadn't brought it to my attention

girl leave that fool alone

somewhere there's one good one left
'cause my poor heart needs somebody who
can take it like a man steady  strong

headed south out of thunder bay 
hit the interstate 
and let the hand of fate just lead him on 
she was heading north out of baton rouge 
nothing left to lose 
all she knew was she had to get gone 
her engine blew in some mississippi river town 
he was passing through when she flagged him down 
hey you never ever know 
where the road will lead you 
when you learn how to let go 
they found something real 
something they could feel 
when they let love take the wheel 
later on on down the road 
when the radio 
played a song about winslow arizona 
she said i'd love to stand on the corner there 
he took it as a dare 
shifted gears and said tonight you're gonna 
he talked about the future she cried about the past 
they talked about forever and never looked back

drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
what i want and i need
and everything that we should be
i'll bet she's beautiful
that girl he talks about
and she's got everything
that i have to live without
drew talks to me
i laugh cause just it's so damn funny radio edit substitutes so damn with just so
that i can't even see
anyone when he's with me
he says he's so in love
he's finally got it right
i wonder if he knows
he's all i think about at night
he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing
don't know why i do
drew walks by me
can he tell that i can't breathe
and there he goes so perfectly
the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight
give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes
and know she's lucky cause
he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing
don't know why i do
so i drive home alone
as i turn out the light
i'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight
he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing
don't know why i do
he's the time taken up
but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into
drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see 
when i woke up this morning
wiped the sleep from my eyes
i found a new day dawning
and suddenly i realize
you're gone
tell me i was dreaming
that you didn't leave me here to cry
you didn't say
you don't love me anymore
it was just my imagination telling lies
tell me that you didn't say goodbye
i'm in a state of confusion
i hope things aren't what they seem
if this is really happening
just let me go back to dream
you're home
tell me i was dreaming
that you didn't leave me here to cry
you didn't say
you don't love me anymore
it was just my imagination telling lies
tell me that you didn't say goodbye
tell me i was dreaming tell me i was dreaming
that you didn't leave me here to cry
you didn't say
you don't love me anymore
it was just my imagination telling lies
oh tell me that you didn't say goodbye
darlin' tell me

goodbye 


there's a girl trying to steal my heart
and i'm tempted
even though she could tare it apart 
i'm tempted
in her eyes there's mystery
every time she smiles at me
i know how it could be 
and i'm tempted
each time she looks my way 
i'm tempted
just a little more every day
i'm tempted
it's so hard to resist
the thought of her sweet kiss
can't take much more of this

deep down inside

and the people came from all around
and all the girls
from there to austin
were slippin' away from home
and puttin' jewlery and hopped to take the trip
to go and listen
to the little darkhaired boy who played the
tennessee flat top box

and he never cared to make it down
but give him his guitar
and he'd be happy all the time

that summer
i went to work for her that summer
a teenage kid so far from home
she was a lonely widowed woman
hellbent to make it on her own
we were a thousand miles from no where
wheat fields as far as i could see
both needing something from each other
not knowing yet what that might be
till she came to me one evening
hot cup of coffee and a smile
in a dress that i was certain 
she hadn't worn in quite a while
there was a difference in her laughter
there was a softness in her eye
and on the air there was a hunger 
even a boy could recognize

she had a need to feel the thunder
to chase the lightning from the sky
to watch the storm with all its wonder
raging in her lover's eye
she had to ride the heat of passion
like a comet burning bright
rushing head long in the wind
now where only dreams had been
burning both ends of the night
that summer wind was all around me
nothing between us but the night
when i had told her that i never
she softly whispered thats all right
and then i watched her hands of leather
turn to velvet in a touch
there's never been another summer
when i have ever learned so much

we had a need to feel the thunder
to chase the lighning from the sky
to watch the storm with all its wonder
raging in each other's eye
we had to ride the heat of passion
like a comet burning bright
rushing head long in the wind
now where only dreams had been 
burning both ends of the night
i often think about that summer
the sweat the moonlight and the lace
i have rarely held another 
when i haven't seen her face
every time i pass a wheat field
watch it dancing with the wind
although i know it isn't real
i just can't help but feel
her hungry arms again 
  she
rushing head long in the wind
now where only dreams had been
burning both ends of the night 


i had to look through our old pictures
to see the way we used to smile
before we left love in the closet
like it just went out of style
can we pull out those old feelin's
wipe the hurt away like dust
make love shine the way it used to shine
find the gold beneath the rust
that's all i need to know
do you wanna stay together
just say let's don't let go
and i'll keep holdin' on forever
have the teardrops that you've cried
drowned the fire in your eyes
is there one flame beneath the smoke
tell me is there any hope
that's all i need to know
is it too late to recover
those old smiles we used to wear
can we save a love that once was strong
before it breaks beyond repair
that's all i need to know
do you wanna stay together
just say let's don't let go
and i'll keep holdin' on forever
have the teardrops that you've cried
drowned the fire in your eyes
is there one flame beneath the smoke
tell me is there any hope
that's all i need to know
is there one flame beneath the smoke
tell me is there any hope
that's all i need to know

havin' a hallelujah good time
a smile on everybody's face
that's what i love about sunday
oh yeah 
that's what i love about sunday
oh yeah 

just'a good ol' boys
never meanin' no harm
beats all you never saw
been in trouble with the law
since the day they was born
staightnin' the curves
flatnin the hills
someday the mountain might get 'em
but the law never will
makin' their way
the only way they know how
that's just a little bit more 
than the law will allow
makin' their way
the only way they know how
that's just a little bit more 
than the law will allow
i'm a good ol' boy
you know my momma loves me
but she don't undestand
they keep a showin my hands and not my face on stage 
in the early rush of morning
trying to get the kids to school
one's hanging on my shirttail
another's locked up in her room
and i'm yelling up the stairs
stop worrying about your hair
you look fine
then they're fighting in the backseat
and i'm playing referee
now someone's gotta go
the moment that we leave
and everybody's late
i swear that i can't wait
till they grow up
then they do
and that's how it is
it's just quiet in the morning
can't believe how much you miss
all they do
and all they did
you want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true
then they do
now the youngest is starting college
she'll be leaving in the fall
and brianna's latest boyfriend
called to ask if we could talk
and i got the impression
that he's about to pop the question 
any day
i look over at their pictures
sitting in their frames
i see them as babies
i guess that'll never change
you pray all their lives
that some day they will find happiness
then they do
and that's how it is
it's just quiet in the morning
can't believe how much you miss
all they do
and all they did
you want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true
then they do
no more monday ptas
no carpools or soccer games
your work is done
now you've got time that's all your own
you've been waiting for so long
for those days to come
then they do
and that's how it is
it's just quiet in the morning
can't believe how much you miss
all they do
and all they did
you want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true
then they do
oh then they do 
i remember trying not to stare the night that i first met you you had me mesmerized
and three weeks later in the front porch light taking forty five minutes to kiss goodnight
i hadnít told you yet but i thought i loved you then
now youíre my whole life now youíre my whole world and i just canít believe the way i feel about you girl

there you were standin' in the shadows

like some big black widow spider
you know just how to catch your prey
i'm actin' like it doesn't matter
and you sneak up from behind and whisper my name
and there goes your paralyzin' eyes
there goes your tantalizin' smile
there goes my act of playin' it cool
and there go the words i meant to say

well we grew up down by the railroad tracks 
shootin' bb's at old beer cans 
chokin' on the smoke from a lucky strike 
somebody lifted off of his old man 
we were football flunkies 
southern rock junkies 
crackin' up the stereos 
singin' loud and proud to gimme three steps 
simple man and curtis low we were good yuh know
we got some discount knowledge at the junior college 
where we majored in beer and girls 
it was all real funny ëtil we ran out of money 
and they threw us out into the world 
yeah the kids that thought they'd run this town 
ain't runnin' much of anything 
just lovin' and laughin' 
and bustin' our asses 
and we call it all livin' the dream 
 
these are my people 
this is where i come from 
we're givin' this life everything we've got and then some 
it ain't always pretty 
but it's real 
it's the way we were made 
wouldn't have it any other way 
these are my people 
well we take it all week on the chin with a grin 
till we make it to a friday night 
and it's church league softball holler ëbout a bad call 
preacher breakin' up the fight 
then later on at the green light tavern 
well everybody's gatherin' as friends 
and the beer is pourin' till monday mornin' 
where we start all over again 
 
we fall down and we get up 
we walk proud and we talk tough 
we got heart and we got nerve 
even if we are a bit disturbed 
 




yes i admit
i've got a thinking problem
she's always on my mind
her memory goes round and round
i've tried to quit a thousand times
yes i admit i've got a thinking problem
fill the glass up to the top
i'll start with loving her
but i don't know when to stop
i wake up and right away
her name is on my lips
once a memory starts to fold
well i can't stop with just one sip
yes i admit
i've got a thinking problem
she's always on my mind
her memory goes round and round
i've tried to quit a thousand times
yes i admit i've got a thinking problem
fill the glass up to the top
i'll start with loving her
but i don't know when to stop
i keep on remembering
how good it used to be
getting stoned all along
on my favorite memory
yes i admit
i've got a thinking problem
she's always on my mind
her memory goes round and round
i've tried to quit a thousand times
yes i admit i've got a thinking problem
fill the glass up to the top
i'll start with loving her
but i don't know when to stop
i'll start with loving her
but i don't know when to stop 
i used to think love was
the soft rope meant to tie me down
and all that could ever own me
was a guitar and another town
ten years can disappear real fast
when every morning just 
leaves somewhere else behind
but i've been thinking about leaving
long enough to change my mind
lyin' here beside you
i can feel it start to pull me away
the thought i'll have again tomorrow
that just came back from yesterday
but your embrace makes any reason
for those memories hard to find
and i've been thinking about leaving
long enough to change my mind
sometimes i miss the warm bright lights
sometimes i miss the crowds
sometimes i miss the women
i wrapped each song around
sometimes i miss that world out there
so empty hard and unkind
but i've been thinking about leaving
long enough to change my mind
  
sometimes i miss the warm bright lights
sometimes i miss the noise
sometimes i miss the fading sounds
of every cheering voice
sometimes i miss that world out there
so empty hard and unkind
but i've been thinking about leaving
long enough to change my mind
but i've been thinking about leaving
long enough to change my mind 
sitting at a tiny table in a ritzy restaurant
she was staring at her coffee cup
he was trying to keep his courage up by applyin' booze
the talk was small when they talked at all
they both knew what they wanted
there was no need to talk about it
they were old enough to scope it out and keep it loose
she said you don't look like my type but i guess you'll do
third rate romance low rent rendezvous
and he said i'll even tell you that i love you if you want me to
third rate romance low rent rendezvous
when they left the bar they got in his car and they drove away
he drove to the family inn 
she didn't even have to pretend she didn't know what for
then he went to the desk and made his request while she waited outside
then he came back with the key and she said
give it to me and i'll unlock the door
she kept sayin' i've never really done this kind of thing before have you
third rate romance low rent rendezvous
and he said yes i have but only a time or two
third rate romance low rent rendezvous

it's a big estate
with wrought iron gates
and palm trees standin' tall
fancy mirrors and chandeliers
comfort wall to wall
and the ocean air is so crisp and clear
and they rave about our view
but there ain't no mountain breeze
and there ain't no hickory trees
and this ain't tennessee
and she ain't you
there's a bedroom suite
where she comes to me
and as her fingers touch my face
i close my eyes and i fantasize
of another time and place
what she feels is so warm and real
and i know her love is true
and she tries so hard to please
still i think sometimes she sees
that this ain't tennessee
and she ain't you
it's not that it's not good enough
and it's not that i'm not man enough
there's just somethin' easy goin' that i love
about you and tennessee
so i made up my mind to learn my lines
and try to play the part
but part of me is in tennessee
and deep down in my heart
i miss my smoky mountain home
and i miss your lovin' too
and it's deep inside of me
and it's always gonna be
'cause this ain't tennessee
and she ain't you 

i don't want another heartbreak
i don't need another turn to cry

i've got the window busted and the door kicked in
from the last time we said never again

but this time i'm going to see you coming
ain't going to be surprised
yea this time
i'm going to know what hit me right between the eyes
just one time i want to think it over
before we speak our minds
i know we can make a go this time 
it's hard and heavy lord day and night
that's the way we love and that's the way we fight
we can't stay together can't be alone
we can go for good but we don't stay gone 
 repeats twice 


i left you with nothing but a few tears in my eyes
now i'm halfway down the interstate past highway 99
it's just me and one good wiper blade up against the rain
 1
and i still hear the echoes of those bitter words we said
and i could drive a million miles and never drive them from my head
those words we said
no matter how i try i can't get far enough away
every sad song on my radio sounds like it's custom made
by some devil on my shoulder that keeps whisperin' in my ear
 2
and i still hear the echoes of those bitter words we said
and i could drive a million miles and never drive them from my head
those words that wounded like an arrow to the heart
and keep me driving
driving
 1 
those words we said
we said 
i can't remember when you weren't there
when i didn't care for anyone but you
i swear we've been through everything there is
can't imagine anything we've missed
can't imagine anything the two of us can't do
through the years you've never let me down
you turned my life around the sweetest days i've found
i've found with you  through the years
i've never been afraid i've loved the life we've made

to be with you  through the years
it's better every day you've kissed my tears away

three thirty in the morning 
not a soul in sight 
the city's lookin' like a ghost town 
on a moonless summer night 
raindrops on the windshield 
there's a storm moving in 
he's headin' back from somewhere 
that he never shoud have been 
and the thunder rolls 
and the thunder rolls 
every light is burnin' 
in a house across town 
she's pacin' by the telephone 
in her faded flannel gown 
askin' for a miracle 
hopin' she's not right 
prayin' it's the weather 
that's kept him out all night 
and the thunder rolls 
and the thunder rolls 
the thunder rolls 
and the lightning strikes 
another love grows cold 
on a sleepless night 
as the storm blows on 
out of control 
deep in her heart 
the thunder rolls 
she's waitin' by the window 
when he pulls into the drive 
she rushes out to hold him 
thankful he's alive 
but on the wind and rain 
a strange new perfume blows 
and the lightnin' flashes in her eyes 
and he knows that she knows 
and the thunder rolls 
and the thunder rolls 
the thunder rolls 
and the lightning strikes 
another love grows cold 
on a sleepless night 
as the storm blows on 
out of control 
deep in her heart 
the thunder rolls 
third verse only done in concert
she runs back down the hallway 
through the bedroom door 
she reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer 
tells the lady in the mirror he won't do this again 
'cause tonight will be the last time 
she'll wonder where he's been 
the thunder rolls 
and the lightning strikes 
another love grows cold 
on a sleepless night 
as the storm blows on 
out of control 
deep in her heart 
the thunder rolls 
three thirty in the morning 
not a soul in sight

askin' for a miracle 
hopin' she's not right 
prayin' it's the weather 
that's kept him out all night 
and the thunder rolls 
and the thunder rolls 
the thunder rolls 
and the lightning strikes 
another love grows cold 
on a sleepless night 
as the storm blows on 
out of control 
deep in her heart 
the thunder rolls 
she's waitin' by the window 
when he pulls into the drive 
she rushes out to hold him 
thankful he's alive 
but on the wind and rain 
a strange new perfume blows 
and the lightnin' flashes in her eyes 
and he knows that she knows 
and the thunder rolls 
and the thunder rolls 
the thunder rolls 
and the lightning strikes 
another love grows cold 
on a sleepless night 
as the storm blows on 
out of control 
deep in her heart 
the thunder rolls 
third verse only done in concert
she runs back down the hallway 
through the bedroom door 
she reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer 
tells the lady in the mirror he won't do this again 
'cause tonight will be the last time 
she'll wonder where he's been 
the thunder rolls 
and the lightning strikes 
another love grows cold 
on a sleepless night 
as the storm blows on 
out of control 
deep in her heart 
the thunder rolls 

every time you take a sip
in this smoky atmosphere
you press that bottle to your lips
and i wish i was your beer
in the small there of your back
your jeans are playing peekaboo
i'd like to see the other half of your butterfly tattoo
hey that gives me an idea
let's get out of this bar
drive out into the country
and find a place to park
'cause i'd like to see you out in the moonlight
i'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
i'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
and i'd like to check you for ticks
i know the perfect little path
out in these woods i used to hunt
don't worry babe i've got your back
and i've also got your front
now i'd hate to waste a night like this
i'll keep you safe you wait and see
the only thing allowed to crawl all over you when we get there is me
you know every guy in here tonight
would like to take you home
but i've got way more class than them
babe that ain't what i want
'cause i'd like to see you out in the moonlight
i'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
i'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
and i'd like to check you for ticks
you never know where one might be
there's lots of places that are hard to reach
i gotcha
i'd like to see you out in the moonlight
i'd like to kiss you baby way back in the sticks
i'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
and i'd like to check you for ticks
i'd sure like to check you for ticks 
she tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore
but i knew she'd never been inside a bar before
and i felt like a peasant who just had met a queen
and she knew i saw right through those tight fittin' jeans
i asked her what's a woman like you doin' here
i see you're used to champagne but i'll buy you a beer
she said you've got me figured out but i'm not what i seem
and for a dance i'll tell you 'bout these tight fittin' jeans
she said i married money i'm used to wearin' pearls
but i've always dreamed of bein' just a good ol' boy's girl
so tonight i left those crystal candlelights to live a dream
and pardner there's a tiger in these tight fittin' jeans
we danced ev'ry dance and lord the beer that we went through
i'm satisfied i did my best to make her dream come true
as she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed
a cowgirl came alive inside those tight fittin' jeans
in my mind she's still a lady that's all i'm gonna say
i knew that i'd been broken by the time we parted ways
and i know i held more woman than most eyes have ever seen
that night i knew a lady wearin' tight fittin' jeans 
well now she's back in her world and i'm still stuck in mine
but i know i'll always remember the time
a cowboy once had a millionaire's dream
and lord i loved that lady wearin' tight fittin' jeans 



i'll need time to get you off my mind
and i may sometimes bother you
try to be in touch with you
even ask too much of you
from time to time
now and then
lord you know i'll need a friend
till i get used to losing you
let me keep on using you
till i can make it on my own
i'll get by but no matter how i try
there'll be times you know i'll call
chances are my tears will fall
and i'll have no pride at all
from time to time
but they say
oh there'll be a brighter day
but till then i lean on you
that's all i mean to do
till i can make it on my own
surely someday i'll look up
and see the morning sun
without another lonely night behind me
then i'll know i'm over you
and all my crying's done
no more hurting memories can find me
but till then 
lord you know i'm gonna need a friend
till i get used to losing you  
if life is like a candle bright death must be the wind
you can close your window tight and it still comes flowing in
so i will climb the highest hill and watch the rising sun
and i pray that i don't feel the chill till i'm too old to die young

let me watch my children grow to see what they become
oh lord don't let that cold wind blow till i'm too old to die young
now i have had some dear sweet friends i thought would never die
now the only thing that's left of them is the teardrops in my eyes
if i could have one wish today and know it would be done
well i would say everyone could stay till they're too old to die young
 twice

tillsonburg tillsonburg
my back still aches when i hear that word

from the nicotine tar on the morning dew of tillsonburg tillsonburg 
tillsonburg tillsonburg
my back still aches when i hear that word
now the nearest river was two miles from

you said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said that's a lie
just a boy in a chevy truck
that had a tendency of gettin' stuck
on backroads at night
an' i was right there beside him all summer long
an' then the time we woke up to find that summer'd gone
but when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
an' my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
september saw a month of tears
an' thankin' god that you weren't here
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed
is a letter that you never read
from three summers back
it's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
an' lookin' back on all of that it's nice to believe
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
an' my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
and i'm back for the first time since then
i'm standin' on your street
an' there's a letter left on your doorstep
an' the first thing that you'll read
is when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
some day you'll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
an' my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
oh think of me
mmmm
you said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said that's a lie

blue jean baby la lady
she was a seamstress for the band
pretty eyed high rate smile
she'll marry a music man
ballerina you must have seen her
dancin in the sand
and now she's in me always with me
tiny dancer in my hand
jesus freaks out in the street
handing tickets out for god
turning back she just laughs
the boulevard is not that bad
piano man he makes his stand
in the auditorium
looking on she sangs the song
the words she knows the tune she hums
but oh how it feels so real
lying here with no one near
only you and you can hear me
when i sing softly slowly

hold me closer tiny dancer
count the headlights on the highway
lay me down in sheets of linen
you had a busy day today
blue jean baby la lady
she was seamstress for the band
pretty eyed pirate smile
hear she married a music man
ballerina you must have seen her
she was dancin in the sand
and now she's in me always with me
tiny dancer in my hand

hold me closer tiny dancer
count the headlights on the highway
lay me down in sheets of linen
you had a busy day today

hold me closer tiny dancer
count the headlights on the highway
lay me down in sheets of linen
you had a busy day today 
when the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i would offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love
when the evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love
i know you haven't made your mind up yet
but i would never do you wrong
i've known it from the moment that we met
there's no doubt in my mind where you belong
i'd go hungry i'd go black and blue
i'd go crawling down the avenue
there ain't nothing that i wouldn't do
to make you feel my love
mmmmm
the storms are raging on a rolling sea
down the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't see nothin' like me yet
there ain't nothin' that i wouldn't do
go to the ends of the earth for you
make you happy make your dreams come true
to make you feel my love 






alone in this house again tonight
i got the tv on
the sound turned down
and a bottle of wine
there's pictures of you and i
on the walls around me
the way that it was
and could've been surrounds me
i'll never get over you walking away
i've never been the kind
to ever let my feelings show
and i thought that being strong
meant never losing selfcontrol
but i'm just drunk enough
to let go of my pain
to hell with my pride
let it fall like rain from my eyes
tonight i wanna cry
would it help if i turned
a sad song on
all by myself
would sure hit me hard
now that your gone
or maybe unfold
some old yellow lost love letters
its gonna hurt bad before it gets better
but i'll never get over you
by hiding this way
'cause i've never been the kind
to ever let my feelings show
and i thought that being strong
meant never losing selfcontrol
but i'm just drunk enough
to let go of my pain
to hell with my pride
let it fall like rain from my eyes
tonight i wanna cry
well i've never been the kind
to ever let my feelings show
i thought that being strong
meant never losing selfcontrol
but i'm just drunk enough
to let go of my pain
to hell with this pride
let it fall like rain from my eyes
tonight i wanna cry 
you've been too gone for too long
it's too late to come back now 
its' been so long since you walked out my door
now you're just an old song nobody sings any more
i've got a new love and she's a true love
but darlin' how could you have known
you've been too gone for too long
now it's too late to come back home
you came a long way goin' the wrong way
don't even set your suitcase down
you wanted to roam now you're paying the bill
you're an old rolling stone who rolled over the hill
i had a good cry when you said goodbye
i didn't want to let you go
but you've been too hgone for too long 
now it's too late to come back home
i had a good cry when you said goodbye
i didn't want to let you go 
but you've been gone for too long
so why don't you just stay gone
now you've been too gone for too long
now it's too late to come back home 


well i was raised in a sophisticated kind of style
yeah my taste in music and women drove my folks half wild
mom and dad had a plan for me
it was debutantes and ersymphonies
but i like my music hot i like my women wild
yeah an' i like my women just a little on the trashy side
when they wear their clothes too tight and their hair is dyed
too much lipstick an' er too much rouge
gets me excited leaves me feeling confused
an' i like my women just a little on the trashy side
shoulda seen the looks on the faces of my dad and mom
when i showed up at the door with a date for the senior prom
they said well pardon us son she ain't no kid
that's a cocktail waitress in a dolly parton wig
i said i know it dad ain't she cool that's the kind i dig
yeah an' i like my women just a little on the trashy side
when they wear their clothes too tight and their hair is dyed
too much lipstick an' er too much rouge
gets me excited leaves me feeling confused
an' i like my women just a little on the trashy side

i like 'em sweet i like 'em with a heart of gold
yeah an' i like 'em brassy i like 'em brazen and bold
well they say that opposites attract well i don't agree
i want a woman just as tacky as me
yeah i like my women just a little on the trashy side
yeah an' i like my women just a little on the trashy side
when they wear their clothes too tight and their hair is dyed
too much lipstick an' er too much rouge
gets me excited leaves me feeling confused
an' i like my women just a little on the trashy side
yeah i like my women an' i like 'em on the trashy side 

i still feel 25 most of the time
i still raise a little cain with the boys
honky tonks and pretty women
lord i'm still right there with them
singing above the crowd and the noise

sometimes i feel like jesse james
still trying to make a name
knowing nothing's gonna change what i am
i was a young troubadour when i rode in on a song
and i'll be an old troubadour when i'm gone
well the truth about a mirror it's that a damned old mirror
don't really tell the whole truth
it don't show what's deep inside or read between the lines
it's really no reflection of my youth

i was a young troubadour when i rode in on a song
i'll be an old troubadour when i'm gone
i'll be an old troubadour when i'm gone 




if you see your brother standing by the road
with a heavy load from the seeds he sowed
and if you see your sister falling by the way
just stop and say you're goin' the wrong way
you've got to try a little kindness yes show a little kindness
yes shine your light for everyone to see
and if you'll try a little kindness and you'll overlook the blindness
of the narrow minded people on the narrow minded streets
don't walk around the down and out lend a helping hand instead of doubt
and the kindness that you show every day will help someone along their way
you've got to try a little kindness
you've got to try a little kindness 



well i'm back again for another night
of trying to break free from this sadness that i can't lay to rest
this old honkytonk sure does feel like home
and the music with the laughter seem to soothe my loneliness
turn it on turn it up turn me loose
from the memory that's driving me lonely crazy and blue
it helps me forget her so the louder the better
hey mister turn it on turn it up turn me loose
if a tear should fall if i should whisper her name
to some stranger i'm holdin' while we're dancin' to an old buck owens song
i know she won't mind she won't even know
she'll be dancing with a memory crying teardrops of her own
turn it on turn it up turn me loose
from the memory that's driving me lonely crazy and blue
it helps me forget her so the louder the better
hey mister turn it on turn it up turn me loose
turn it on turn it up turn me loose
from the memory that's driving me lonely crazy and blue
it helps me forget her so the louder the better
hey mister turn it on turn it up turn me loose
yeah mister turn it on turn it up turn me loose 


aaron linesmonty powelltroy verges
hey mom i know that it's late hope i didn't wake you
yeah everything is ok just needed to talk to you
today i had one of those days
but i didn't call to complain
just to say everything that i didn't for all of those years
you were a taxicab driver a nurse and a maid
a waitress a cook and a shoulder to lay
my head on to cry on when nothing was going my way
you knew every answer without cracking a book
and i took for granted that i had it so good
and i'm sorry it's taken me so long to say
thank you i love you
twenty years late
it's funny how time passing by can change your perspective
a little while out on your own can sure make you think
i don't know how you did it
no i can't find one spare minute
the days run together but i don't remember you
ever letting us down
you were the judge and the jury when i did wrong
been my biggest fan from my very first song
the gas in the engine that always kept me moving on
a seamstress a counselor and the one referee
that could cold stop a fight between my brother and me
and i'm sorry it's taken me so long to say
thank you i love you
twenty years late
i'll let you go now
but i hope that you know now how i feel
thank you for making me the man i've become
i love you and i will always be your son
mom that's all i called to say
20 years late
20 years late
20 years late

just the other night
at a hometown football game
my wife and i ran into
my old highschool flame
and as i introduced them
the past came back to me
and i couldn't help but think of
the way things used to be
she was the one
that i'd wanted for all times
and each night i'd spend prayin'
that god would make her mine
and if he'd only granted me
this wish i'd wished back then
i'd never ask for anything again
sometimes i thank god
for unanswered prayers
remember when you're talkin'
to the man upstairs
that just because he doesn't answer
doesn't mean he don't care
some of god's greatest gifts are
unanswered prayers
she wasn't quite the angel
that i remembered in my dreams
and i could tell that time had changed me
and her eyes too it seemed
we tried to talk about the old days
there wasn't much we could recall
i guess the lord knows
what he's doing after all
and as she walked away
well i looked at my wife
and then and there i thanked the good lord
for the gifts in my life
sometimes i thank god
for unanswered prayers
remember when you're talkin'
to the man upstairs
and just because he may not answer
doesn't mean he don't care
some of gods greatest gifts
are unanswered
some of gods greatest gifts 
are all too often unanswered
some of god's greatest gifts are
unanswered prayers

in the city that is made of gold
o the land of cloudless day
o the land of an unclouded day
o they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
o they tell me of an uncloudy day
o they tell me that he smiles on his children there
and his smile drives their sorrows all away
and they tell me that no tears ever come again
in that lovely land of uncloudy day

you're all i need my love my valentine
all of my life
i have been waiting for
all you give to me
you've opened my eyes
and shown me how to love unselfishly

i've dreamed of this a thousand times before
but in my dreams i couldn't love you more
i will give you my heart
until the end of time
you're all i need my love my valentine
piano solo

and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart
until the end of time
'cause all i need is you my valentine
you're all i need my love my valentine 
well it took a little time
but i guess you finally learned
that promises get broken
and bridges do get burned
you've been sitfin' through the ashes
just tryin' to find a flame
holdin' on to nothin'
you're a victim of the game
you were standin' way too close
to see it all apart
and there were things you couldn't hear
'cause you were listening with your heart
but you can't say i didn't warn you
now there's no one else to blame
there's no one quite as blind 
as the victim of the game
and it dont matter who you are
it treats everyone the same
all you need's a heart 
to be a victim of the game
you know it's really gettin' to you
when you take to tellin' lies
and you can try to fool your friends
but you can't look 'em in the eye
there ain't no standin' tall 
in the shadow of the shame
when everybody knows 
that you're a victim of the game
and it dont matter who you are
it treats everyone the same
all you need's a heart 
to be a victim of the game
oh you know when i look into your eyes
i can really feel the pain
starin' in the mirror
at a victim of the game 





sittin' on a bench at west town mall 
he sat down in his overalls and asked me
you waitin' on a woman
i nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
he said son since nineteen fiftytwo i've been
waitin' on a woman
when i picked her up for our first date
i told her i'd be there at eight
and she came down the stairs at eightthirty
she said i'm sorry that i took so long
didn't like a thing that i tried on
but let me tell you son she sure looked pretty
yeah she'll take her time but i don't mind
waitin' on a woman
he said the wedding took a year to plan
you talk about an anxious man i was nervous
waitin' on a woman
and then he nudged my arm like old men do
and said i'll say this about the honeymoon it was worth it
waitin' on a woman
and i don't guess we've been anywhere
she hasn't made us late i swear
sometimes she does it just 'cause she can do it
boy it's just a fact of life
it'll be the same with your young wife
might as well go on and get used to it
she'll take her time 'cause you don't mind
waitin' on a woman
i've read somewhere statistics show
the man's always the first to go
and that makes sense 'cause i know she won't be ready
so when it finally comes my time
and i get to the other side
i'll find myself a bench if they've got any
i hope she takes her time 'cause i don't mind
waitin' on a woman
honey take your time cause i don't mind
waitin' on a woman 
you say you're sorry once again dear
you want me to take you back once more
you say you need a helping hand dear
but that's what you told me once before

walk softly on this heart of mine love
don't treat it mean and so unkind
let it rest in peace and quiet love
walk softly on this heart of mine
walk on
i know someday you'll find a new love
i'll feel your heart has turned to stone
but please let me down real easy
cause loneliness moves in as you move on

walk softly on this heart of mine
walk softly on this heart of mine
walk softly on this heart of mine 
walk through this world with me 
go where i go
share all my my dreams with me
i need you so
in life we search and some of us find
i've looked for you a long long time
and now that i've found you 
new horizons i see
come take my hand 
and walk through this world with me
  
walk through this world with me 
go where i go

along the highway
well thats just my way
of sayin' i love you
i'm always walkin'
after midnight
searchin' for you
i stop to see a weapin' willow
cryin' on his pillow
maybe hes cryin' for me
and as the skies turn gloomy
night winds whisper to me
i'm lonesome as i can be
i go a walkin'
after midnight
out in the starlight
just hoping you may be
somewere a walkin'

after midnight
out in the starlight

sam hoginmark d sanders

when we dance together my world's in disguise it's a fairyland tale that come true
and when you look at me with those stars in your eyes
i could waltz across texas with you
waltz across texas with you in my arms waltz across texas with you
like a storybook ending i'm lost in your charms
and i could waltz across texas with you
 steel  acguitar 
my heartaches and troubles are just up and gone the moment that you come in view
and with your hand in mine dear i could dance on and on
and i could waltz across texas with you
waltz across texas 
i've packed a cooler and a change of clothes
let's jump and see how far it goes
you got my heart and your daddy's boat
we got all night to make it float
we could sit on the shore we could just be friends
or we could jump in
whole world could change in a minute
just one kiss could stop this spining
we could think it through
but i don't want to if you don't want to
we could keep things just the same
leave here the way we came with nothing to lose
but i don't want to if you don't want to
i got your ring around my neck
and a couple of nights i don't regret
you got a dream of a degree
and a shirt that smells like me
yeah we both got dreams we could chase alone
or we could make our own
whole world could change in a minute
just one kiss could stop this spining
we could think it through
but i don't want to if you don't want to
we could keep things just the same
leave here the way we came with nothing to lose
but i don't want to if you don't want to
never waste another day
wonderin' what you threw away
holdin me holdin you
i don't want to if you don't want to
we could keep things just the same
leave here the way we came with nothing to lose
but i don't want to but you don't want to
but i want you 


wasted days and wasted nights
i have left for you behind
for you don't belong to me
your heart belongs 
to someone else
why should i keep loving you
when i know that you're not true
and why should i call your name
when you're the blame 
for making me blue
don't you remember the day
that you went away 
and left me
i was so lonely
prayed for you only
my love
why should i keep loving you
when i know that you're not true
and why should i call you're name
when you're the blame 
for making me blue
don't you remember the day
that you went away 
and left me
i was so lonely
prayed for you only
my love
why should i keep loving you
when i know that you're not true
and why should i call your name
when you're the blame
for making me blue 
standing at the back door she tried to make it fast
one tear hit the hardwood it fell like broken glass
she said sometimes love slips away 
and you just can't get it back lets face it
for one split second she almost turned around
but that would be like pouring raindrops back into a cloud
so she took another step and said 
i see the way out and i'm gonna take it
i don't wanna spend my life jaded waiting
to wake up one day and find
that i let all these years go by wasted
another glass of whiskey but it still don't kill the pain
he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
he said it's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
gotta face it

i don't wanna spend my life jaded waiting
to wake up one day and find
that i let all these years go by wasted
i don't wanna keep on wishing missing
the still of the morning the color of the night
i ain't spending no more time wasted
she kept driving along ëtil the moon and the sun
were floating side by side
he looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
for the first time in a while

at a caramel colored sunset sky

driving through town just my boy and me
with a happy meal in his booster seat
knowing that he couldn't have the toy
till his nuggets were gone
green traffic light turned straight to red
i hit my breaks and mumbled under my breath
his fries went a flying and his orange drink covered his lap
well then my four year old said a four letter word

i bowed my head and i prayed real hard
said lord please help me help my stupid self
then this side of bedtime later that night
turning on my son's scooby doo nightlight
he crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
he closed his little eyes folded his little hands
and spoke to god like he was talking to a friend
and i said son now where'd you learn to pray like that
 two
he said i've been watching you dad ain't that cool

i was drivin' through georgia in late july

i saw a homemade sign writtin' in red 
rhine county watermelon festival ahead
well i wasn't in a hurry so i slowed down
took a two lane road to a one horse town
there was a party goin' on when i got there
i heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor
chourus
he said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
made from the biggest watermelons on the vine

when the band started playin the watermelon queen

she grabbed me by the arm said come on lets go

she craweled across the floor and jumped back to her feet
she wiggled and she giggled and be all you ever saw

if i could grant you one wish
i wish you could see the way you kiss
ooh i love watching you baby
when you're driving me ooh crazy

ooh i love the way you love the way you love me
there's no where else i'd rather be
ooh to feel the way i feel with your arms around me
i only wish that you could see the way you love me
love me ooh the way you love me
it's not right it's not fair
what you're missing over there
someday i'll find a way to show you
just how lucky i am to know you

you're the million reasons why there's
love reflecting in my eyes
 til fade 
the summer air was heavy and sweet
you and i on a crowded street
there was music everywhere i can see us there
in a happy little foreign town
where the stars hung upside down
a half a world away far far away
i remember you were laughing
we were so in love we were so in love

and the band played 
songs that we had never heard
but we danced anyway
we never understood the words
we just sang oh la la la la la la la la 
and we danced anyway
well they say you can't go back
but baby i don't believe that
come along with me come on and dance with me
well maybe if i hold you close
baby we could just let go
of these things that tie us down we'll come back around
you remember we were laughing
we were so in love so in love
chrous
you remember we were laughing
we were so in love we were so in love
and the band played 
songs that we had never heard
but we danced anyway
we never understood the words
we just sang oh la la la la la la la la 
la la la of the world
ohhhhhh
and we dance anyway oohh we were laughing ohh
ohhhh
and we danced anyway
ohh we were dancing ohh 

this ain't coming from no prophet
just an ordinary man
when i close my eyes i see
the way this world shall be
when we all walk hand in hand
when the last child cries for the crust of bread
when the last man dies for just words that he said
when there's shelter over the poorest head
then we shall be free
when the last thing we notice is the color of skin
and the first thing we look for is the beauty within
when the skys and the oceans are clean again
then we shall be free
we shall be free we shall be free
stand straight and walk proud
'cause we shall be free
when we're free to love anyone we choose
and this worlds big enough for all different views
when we all can worship from our own kind of pew
then we shall be free
we shall be free we shall be free
have a little faith hold out
'cause we shall be free
and when money talks for the very last time
and no body walks a step behind
when there's only one race and that's mankind
then we shall be free
we shall be free we shall be free
stand straight walk proud
'cause we shall be free
we shall be free we shall be free
stand straight have a little faith walk proud
cause we shall be free
we shall be free we shall be free
stand straight walk proud
cause we shall be free 
i oughta know the look in another's eyes 
when there's something on their mind 
i think i saw that look in a lover's eyes 
they were looking into mine 
like we both had found the one we want 
but found the one we wanted just quit trying 
so we tell ourselves that what we found is what we meant to find 
that's what we tell ourselves 
you won't believe the things a heart could tell a mind 
somehow we sell ourselves on love
i just don't think i'll believe my heart this time 
i oughta know the language 
well i've heard me tell myself these things before 
i finally made my mind up 
my heart tells me to look for something more 
determined not to wind up wondering was she the one 
well you never can be sure 
 
if i could invent a time machine
baby we'd both be seventeen
cruising in my first car
acting like movie stars on friday night
do you remember those friday nights 

when we were a rock ready to roll
and there was a fire down in our soul
when all the whole world had to stand still
then turn around us 'cause that was the deal
and oh how those nights went flowing like wine
when i was all yours and you were all mine
and we were in love yeah we were in love 
i can still see you when i sleep
and there is a picture i still keep
of you with your hair in the wind
and me with that crazy grin
under a summer sky
when dreams were too young to die 
 
i know i know it sounds crazy
but baby you're still the one
so let's find a way to bring back the days
when our hearts were forever young

kostas raul malo
wasn't i good to you
didn't i show it
and if i ever hurt you
i didn't know it
if you think i don't care
then you're mistaken
my love was always there
but now my heart's breakin'

oh baby oh what a crying shame
to let it all slip away
and call it yesterday
oh baby my life would be so blue
my heart would break in two
oh what a crying shame
'cause i believed in you
from the beginning
i thought our love was true
but now it's all ending
 twice
oh what a crying shame
oh what a crying shame
oh what a crying shame
oh what a crying shame 


hey i've been around i've seen it all
love is a chain around your heart
that holds you down
you're better off runnin' away before it starts
i wanted to chase my dreams
i thought freedom meant everything but
hey hey what do i know
i'm just a lonely fool that let you go
and now what do i do
thought i could live without you but
what do i know
look who i've become i wanted it all
oh but it hasn't happened yet
look what i've done i've built a wall
in between me and happiness
i had the answers i made the rules
and i thought i had nothing to lose but
hey hey what do i know
i'm just a lonely fool that let you go
and now what do i do
thought i could live without you but
what do i know
i had the answers i made the rules
and i thought i had nothing to lose but
hey hey what do i know
i'm just a lonely fool that let you go
and now what do i do
thought i could live without you without you but
what do i know
but what do i know 


i heard it through the grapevine
my new neighbor don't like my big red barn
a '47 ford bullet holes in the door
broke down motor in the front yard
i got half a mind to paint a plywood sign
and nail it up on a knotty pine tree
saying i was here first
this is my piece of dirt
and your rambling don't rattle me
some people care about what other people think
worry about what they say
let a little gossip
coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
saying blah blah blah just a jacking their jaws
gotta let it roll offa my back
i don't give a dern what other people think
what do ya think about that
i wear what i want to overalls work boots
crank my music up loud
like to sling a little mud in my four wheel drive
trek it all into town
shot a little eight ball down at the pool hall
drink a beer with my friends
now don't judge me and i won't judge you
cause we all get judged in the end
some people care about what other people think
worry about what they say
let a little gossip
coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
saying blah blah blah just a jacking their jaws
gotta let it roll offa my back
i don't give a dern what other people think
what do ya think about that
some people care about what other people think
worry about what they say
let a little gossip
coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
saying blah blah blah just a jacking their jaws
gotta let it roll offa my back
i don't give a dern what other people think
what do ya think about that
say i don't give a damn what other people think
what do ya think about that
what do ya think about that 
i can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
that don't bother me
i can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
i'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
even though going on with you gone still upsets me
there are days every now and again i pretend i'm okay
but that's not what gets me
what hurts the most
was being so close
and having so much to say
and watching you walk away
and never knowing
what could have been
and not seeing that loving you
is what i was tryin' to do
it's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere i go
but i'm doin' it
it's hard to force that smile when i see our old friends and i'm alone
still harder getting up getting dressed livin' with this regret
but i know if i could do it over
i would trade give away all the words that i saved in my heart
that i left unspoken
what hurts the most
was being so close
and having so much to say
and watching you walk away
and never knowing
what could have been
and not seeing that loving you
is what i was tryin' to do
what hurts the most
was being so close
and having so much to say
and watching you walk away
and never knowing
what could have been
and not seeing that loving you
is what i was tryin' to do
not seeing that loving you
that's what i was tryin' to do 



i heard the door slam 
and i couldn't tell was it just the wind 
or was she mad again  ah hell 
she's gettin in her car 
i hollered baby is there something wrong 
thought i heard her say something sounded like i'm gone 
but these days gone can mean so many things 
well theres gone for good and theres good and gone 
and theres gone with the long before it 
i wish she'd been just a little more clear 
well theres gone for the day and gone for the night 
and gone for the rest of your dogone life 
is it whiskey night or just a couple beers 
i mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here 
well its gettin dark out she ain't back yet 
ain't called home turned off the phone 
ah man hah this might not be good 
i would have stopped her when she went to leave 
but i didn't 'cause i didn't really think what i'm thinkin now 
i'm still not sure what gone is all about 
well theres gone for good and theres good and gone 
and theres gone with the long before it 
i wish she'd been just a little more clear 
well theres gone for the day and gone for the night 
and gone for the rest of your dogone life 
is it whiskey night or just a couple beers 
i mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here 
is it the kind of gone where she's at her mom's cooling down 
she'll come around or the kind that says you had your chance 
and she ain't comin back 
well theres gone for good and theres good and gone 
and theres gone with the long before it 
i wish she'd been just a little more clear 
well theres gone for the day and gone for the night 
and gone for the rest of your dogone life 
is it whiskey night or just a couple beers 
i mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here 
i mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout 
what kinda gone are we talkin bout 
yes what kinda gone are we talkin bout here 
what kinda gone 


i thought i knew the girl so well
if she was sad i couldn't tell
i missed the point i missed the signs
so if she's gone the fault is mine
i know i know a whole lot of little things
and even though
i could list them 1 by 1
she would still be gone

her eyes are blue
her hair was long
64 she was born in baton rouge
her favorite song is  in my life
i memorized her every move
i knew her books her car her clothes
but i paid no attention to what mattered most
i never ask she never said
and when she cried i turned my head
she dreamed her dreams behind closes doors
that made them easy to ignore
and i know i know
i missed the forest for the trees
and all i have to show
oh but she walked out the door
cold facts and nothing more
her eyes are blue
her hair was long
64 she was born in baton rouge
her favorite song is  in my life
i memorized her every move
i knew her books her car her clothes
but i paid no attention to what mattered most
her eyes are blue
her hair was long
64 she was born in baton rouge
her fathers tall
her mothers gone
she moved out west when she was 2
the way she laughed 
the way she loved
oh my god what did i do 
bob regan  mark d sanders
i gave you my young my tender years
what more do you want from me
my laughter and my lonely tears
what more do you want from me
i've been faithful to you beginning to end
isn't that enough
i gave you my all and i gave it again
what more do you want

oh love what else could there be
oh love what more do you want from me
i've been fooled by what i believe was you
oh what a sweet disguise
i pledged my heart forever true
'cause i thought it was you in his eyes

give me a clue what is it with you
is there somethin' that i can't see
what more do you need what more could there be
what more do you want from me 
sir if you dont mind i'd rather be alone
from the moment i walked in tonight
you've been coming on
if i've told you once i've told you twice
i'm just here to unwind
i'm not interested in romance
or what you have in mind 

what part of 'no' don't you understand
to put it plain and simple
i'm not into one night stands
i'd be glad to explain
if it's too hard to comprehend
what part of 'no' don't you understand 
i appreciate the drink and the rose was nice of you
i don't mean to be so mean
but i don't think i'm getting through
i don't need company no i don't wanna dance
so what part of 'no' don't you understand 
 
last time i saw her it was turnin' colder
but that was years ago
last i heard she had moved to boulder
but where she's now i don't know
but there's somethin' 'bout this time of year
that spins my head around
takes me back makes me wonder
what she's doin' now

'cause what she's doin' now is tearin' me apart
fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart
i can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
and i wonder if she knows what she's doin' now
just for laughs i dialed her old number
but no one knew her name
hung up the phone sat there and wondered
if she'd ever done the same
i took a walk in the evenin' wind
to clear my head somehow
but tonight i lie here thinkin'

but that s a feelin you ll get over overnight

cause whatcha gonna do with a cowboy
when that old rooster crows at dawn
when he s lyin there instead
of getttin out of bed
and puttin on his boots and gettin gone
what you gonna do when he says honey
i ve got half a mind to stay
what you gonna do with a cowboy
when he don t saddle up and ride away
you can see it takes a special kinda woman
to put with the life a cowboy leads
cause his boots are always muddy
and his beer drinkin buddies
will camp out on your couch and never leave
don t even start to think you re gonna change him
you d be better off to try and rope the wind
what you see is what he s got
and he can t be what he s not
and honey you can t hide him from your friends
 
she got eyes that cut you like a
knife and
lips that taste like sweet red wine
and pretty legs go to heaven every time
she got a gentle way that puts me at ease
when she walks in the room i can hardly breathe
got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees
she got whatever it is
it blows me away
she's everything i wanted to say to a woman
but couldn't find the words to say
she got whatever it is
i don't know what to do
and every time i try and tell her how i feel
it comes out i love you
you got whatever it is
you know i've never been the type that would ever want to
stay
bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
but that all changed when she walked into my life
and people askin why it is
i tell them i don't know
just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
and she's gonna be my wife
she got whatever it is
it blows me away
she's everything i wanted to say to a woman
but couldn't find the words to say
she got whatever it is
i don't know what to do
every time i try and tell her how i feel
it comes out i love you
you got whatever it is
now when she loves me
girl that's how i feel
when she loves me i'm on top of the world
when she loves me i can live forever
when she loves me i am untouchable
you got whatever it is
it blows me away
you're everything i wanted to say to a woman
but couldn't find the words to say
you got whatever it is
i don't know what to do
every time i try and tell her how i feel
it comes out i love you i do
you got whatever it is
oh you got whatever it is 
deep in denialville
tryin' a' fight the way i feel
i go jello when you smile
i start blushin'my head rushin'
if you stand too close to me
i might melt down from the heat
if ya' look my way one more time
i'm gonna go out of my mind
whatever you do
don't even think about it
don't go and get me started
don't you dare drive me crazy
don't do that to me baby

my heart pumpin' to the max
i'm such a sucker for your eyes
they permanently paralyze
whatever you do
don't even think about it
don't go and get me started
don't you dare drive me crazy
don't do that to me baby
whatever you do don't do that to me
you got my heart under attack

cause we'll keep the good times rolling
wait and see wait and seeoh wait and see
his exhaltation a sweet disintegration
a few discolourations then it comes along
up is why he chooses the kisses and the bruises
there ain't nothing he refuses then it comes along
it comes along and i am lifted i am lifted i am lifted

when i'm up i can't get down
can't get down can't get level
when i'm up i can't get down
get my feet back on the ground
when i'm up i can't get down
can't get down can't get level
when i'm up i can't get down
get my feet back on the ground
he just needs something to blind him
something to wind him up
it won't take long to find him
when it comes on strong
wise guys are grinning street lights are spinning
the night is just beginning and then it comes on strong
it comes on strong and i am lifted i am lifted i am lifted

oh it comes on strong and i am lifted
it comes on strong and i am lifted
i am lifted i am lifted
 

when your heart is all alone every second
seems so long
when it's just you you can't see through
those ol' clouds that rain so blue
but when somebody loves you
there's nothing you can't do
when somebody loves you
it's easy to get through
when somebody loves you
the way i love you
when it's late the sun hangs low
by yourself nowhere to go
sing a song you dance alone
play solitaire and stare at the phone
but when somebody loves you
there's nothing you can't do
when somebody loves you
it's easy to get through
when somebody loves you
the way i love you
so let's put aside our foolish pride
and let our hearts say hello
we both agree we're just no good
at bein' on our own
'cause when somebody loves you
there's nothing you can't do
when somebody loves you
it's easy to get through
when somebody loves you
the way i love you
the way i love you
the way i love you 
when the lights go down
he'll be filling a pan with the broom in his hand
in some drive across town
he'll be wiping the bar and mopping the floor
countin' his tips and locking the doors
wrestling the devil that tells him to pour another round
when the lights go down
she'll be callin' her friends from her mercedes benz
but it's too late now
they were there for the fame the flash and the thrill
the drop of the name the parties the pills
as another star falls from the hollywood hills without a sound
when the lights go down
and there's nothing left to be
when the lights go down
and the truth is all you see
when you feel that hole inside your soul
you wonder what you're made of 
well we all find out
when the lights go down
when the lights go down
at the end of the day when this game that i play
has gone another round
as i lay there alone on this big empty bed
with nothing but thoughts of you in my head
i think of the things that i wish i had said
when you were still around
when the lights go down yeah
and there's nothing left to be
when the lights go down
and the truth is all you see
and i wonder if all my life's about the sum
of all my fears and all my doubts
yeah when the lights go down
when the lights go
 down ooh 
and there's nothing left to be
when the light go down yeah
and the truth is all you see
when you feel that hole inside your soul
you wonder what you're made of 
well we all find out
when the lights go down
ooh when the lights go down 
dancin' where the stars go blue 
dancin' where the evening fell 
dancin' in your wooden shoes 
in a wedding gown 
dancin' out on 7th street 
dancin' through the underground 
dancin' little marionette 
are you happy now 
where do you go when you're lonely 
where do you go when you're blue 
where do you go when you're lonely 
i'll follow you 
when the stars go blue 
laughing with your pretty mouth 
laughing with your broken eyes 
laughing with your lover's tongue 
in a lullaby
where do you go when you're lonely 
where do you go when you're blue 
where do you go when you're lonely 
i'll follow you 
when the stars go blue 
the stars go blue stars go blue 
i've been cheated
been mistreated
when will i be loved
i've been put down
i've been pushed 'round
when will i be loved
when i find a new man
that i want for mine
he always breaks my heart in two
it happens every time
i've been made blue
i've been lied to
when will i be loved
when i find a new man
that i want for mine
he always breaks my heart in two
it happens every time
oh i've been cheated
been mistreated
when will i be loved
when will i be loved
tell me when will i be loved 
this could be it i think i'm in love
it's love this time
it just seems to fit i think i'm in love
this love is mine
i can see you with me when i'm older
all my lonely night are finally over
you took the weight of the world off my
shoulders the world just goes away

oh when you kiss me
i know you miss me
and when you're with me
the world just goes away
the way you hug me
the way you show me that you
adore meoh when you kiss me
oh yeah
you are the one i think i'm in love
life has begun
i can see the two of us together
i know i'm gonna be with you forever
love couldn't be any better

 solo
i can see you with me when i'm older
all my lonely nights are finally over
you took the weight of the world off my
shoulders the world just goes away

and when you kiss me
i know you miss me
oh the world just goes away
when you kiss me 
1st verse
oh
maybe tonight
we could close the door and lock ourselves inside
take time to feel
i don't want to miss the chance to be so real
the days all fly away and i forget the truth
everything that matters is in this room

when you lie next to me
breathin' the air i breathe
we don't have to speak
and just be whoa
our love's a precious thing
don't wanna waste a day
or one more minute
without you in it
life is so sweet
when you lie next to me
when you lie next to me
2nd verse
my heart is yours
and every part of me still wants to give you more
more time to love
'cause you never know when life will leave us
i want to take in all the beauty here oh
let the world around us just disappear
 out 
it's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
without saying a word you can light up the dark
try as i may i could never explain
what i hear when you don't say a thing
the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
the touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever i fall
you say it best when you say nothing at all
all day long i can hear people talking outloud
but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
old mr webster could never define
what's being said between your heart and mine
the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
the touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever i fall
you say it best when you say nothing at all
the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
the touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever i fall
you say it best when you say nothing at all

where were you when the world stopped turning on that september day
were you in the yard with your wife and children
or working on some stage in la
did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
risin' against that blue sky
did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
or did you just sit down and cry
did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
and pray for the ones who don't know
did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
and sob for the ones left below
did you burst out in pride for the red white and blue
and the heroes who died just doin' what they do
did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
and look at yourself and what really matters

i'm just a singer of simple songs
i'm not a real political man
i watch cnn but i'm not sure i can tell 
you the difference in iraq and iran
but i know jesus and i talk to god
and i remember this from when i was young
faith hope and love are some good things he gave us
and the greatest is love
where were you when the world stopped turning on that september day
were you teaching a class full of innocent children
or driving down some cold interstate
did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
in a crowded room did you feel alone
did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her
did you dust off that bible at home
did you open your eyes hope it never happened
close your eyes and not go to sleep
did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
or speak to some stranger on the street
did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
or go out and buy you a gun
did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
and turn on i love lucy reruns
did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
did you stand in line and give your own blood
did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
thank god you had somebody to love
 2x
and the greatest is love
and the greatest is love
where were you when the world stopped turning that september day 
written by jimmy webb  1969 
the end has come and found us here
with our toys scattered all around us here
the puzzle that we never found an answer for
still asks us darlin' just what all the games were for
and here we stand in a box of sand
where's the playground susie
you're the one who's supposed to know her way around
where's the playground susie
if i don't stay around
if i don't stay around
the carousel has stopped us here
it twirled a time or two and then it dropped us here
and still you're not content with something about me
but what merrygoround can you ride without me
to take your hand† 
how would you stand
where's the playground susie
if i decide to let you go and play around
where's the playground susie
if i don't stay around
if i don't stay around
where's the playground susie
you're the one who's supposed to know her way around
where's the playground susie
if i decide to let you go and play around 
this desert wind is burnin' my face again 
god i'm missin' you 
been runnin' blind under a broken sky 
with regrets i was sorting through 
but lesson learned baby 
i've made the turn 
wherever you are 
no matter how far 
girl i'm gonna find my way to you 
through rivers of rain 
over mountains of pain 
do whatever on earth i've gotta do 
i'll follow the dream i'll follow my heart 
girl i've gotta be 
wherever you are 
so many miles to where we said goodbye 
to the street of shattered dreams 
i'm prayin' hard you didn't start a life 
with someone who's not me 
and if you're just gone 
girl i'll be movin' on 
 
let the sunrise find me searchin' 
let the west wind carry my plea 
give this changed man one more last chance 
open your arms to me 
wherever you are 
through rivers of rain 
over mountains of pain 
do whatever on earth i've gotta do 
i'll follow the dream i'll follow my heart 
girl i've gotta be 
wherever you are 
wherever you are 
wherever you are 
bottle of scotch whiskey not very smooth 
like snake bite cure from the medicine man 
not bad poison if there's something to soothe 
it's a whole other world in the palm of your hand 
out of this world and out of your mind 
just like it don't matter what you're leaving behind 
trying to change your life you change your point of view 
but no matter what you do it's the same old you 
wherever you go there you are 
you can run from yourself but you won't get far 
you can dive to the bottom of your medicine jar 
but wherever you go there you are 
bottle of scotch whiskey whatever you find 
when you're out on a wire it's a matter of time 
changing every moment when you're taking the fall 
there's everything to gain when you're losing it all 
feel your head spinning with your feet on the ground 
you climb the wrong ladder and it's keeping you down 
think you're gettin' higher but you're still layin' low 
you don't want to be anyone you know 
 
once you've been bitten it's like crossing a line 
it's a part of the plan all that's on your mind 
think that it'll help you find somebody to be 
but the man in the mirror is all you'll see 
 
don't my baby look good in them blue jeans
tight on the top with a belly button ring
a little tattoo somewhere in between
she only shows to me
hey we're going out dancin' she's ready tonight
so damn goodlookin' boys it ain't even right
and when bartender says for the lady
what's it gonna be
i tell him man

she ain't into wine and roses
beer just makes her turn up her nose
and she can't stand the thought of sippin' champagne
no cuervo gold margaritas
just ain't enough good burn in tequila
she needs somethin' with a little more edge and a little more pain
she's my little whiskey girl
she's my little whiskey girl
my raggedontheedges girl
ah but i like 'em rough
baby got a '69 mustang
four on the floor and you oughta hear the pipes ring
i jump behind the wheel and it's away we go
hey i drive too fast but she don't care
blue bandana tied all up in her hair 
just sittin' there singin' every song on the radio
 x 2
whoa she's my little whiskey girl
my raggedontheedges girl
ah but i like 'em rough
yeah i like 'em rough
i like 'em rough 
brad
she put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
she broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
we watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
but he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
until the night
 
he put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
and finally drank away her memory
life is short but this time it was bigger
than the strength he had to get up off his knees
we found him with his face down in the pillow
with a note that said i'll love her 'til i die
and when we buried him beneath the willow
the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
both
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
alison
the rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
for years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
she finally drank her pain away a little at a time
but she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
until the night
 both
she put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
and finally drank away his memory
life is short but this time it was bigger
than the strength she had to get up off her knees
we found her with her face down in the pillow
clinging to his picture for dear life
we laid her next to him beneath the willow
while the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la 
i heard a freight train out across the way
i heard a woman sing amazing grace
i heard a night bird call to its mate
when i heard you whisper my name
i heard freedom break its chain
i heard a heart beat where once no sound remained
i heard angels rise and praise
when i heard you whisper my name

i heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
i heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
and i heard hatred fall from grace
when i heard you whisper my name
beating softly against the waves
fell a sound of an early morning rain
and though the lightning and thunder came
i still heard you whisper my name

and i heard angels rise and praise
when i heard you whisper my name 
say you're sorry
that face of an angel comes out just when you need it to
as i paced back and forth all this time 
cause i honestly believed in you
holding on the days drag on
stupid girl i should have known i should have known
that i'm not a princess this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
maybe i was naive got lost in your eyes
and never really had a chance
my mistake i didn't know to be in love
you had to fight to have the upper hand
i had so many dreams about you and me
happy endings now i know
that i'm not a princess this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
and there you are on your knees
begging for forgiveness begging for me
just like i always wanted but i'm so sorry
'cause i'm not your princess this ain't a fairytale
i'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
this is a big world that was a small town
there in my rear view mirror disappearing now
and it's too late for you and your white horse
now it's too late for you and your white horse
to catch me now
oh oh oh
try and catch me now ohh
it's too late to catch me now 




i spent 20 years tryin' to get out of this place 
i was looking for something i couldn't replace 
i was running away from the only thing i've ever known 
and like a blind dog without a bone
i was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
i hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
i've been there done that i ain't looking back 
the seeds i've sown saving dimes spending too much time on the telephone
who says you can't go home
who says you can't go home 
there's only one place that call me one of their own 
just a hometown boy born a rolling stone who says you can't go home 
who says you can't go back been around all around the world and that's a matter of fact 
there's only one place left i wanna go who says you can't go home 
it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright 
i went as far as i could i tried to find a new face
there isn't one of these lines that i would erase
i left a million miles of memories on that road 
and every step i take i know that i'm not alone
you take the home from the boy but not the boy from his home
these are my streets the only life i've ever known
who says you can't go home
who says you can't go home 
there's only one place that call me one of their own 
just a hometown boy born a rolling stone who says you can't go home 
who says you can't go back been around all around the world and that's a matter of fact 
there's only one place left i wanna go who says you can't go home 
it doesn't matter where you are doesn't matter where you go 
if it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road 
take it in take it with you when you go who says you can't go home 
who says you can't go back been around all around the world and that's a matter of fact 
there's only one place left i wanna go who says you can't go home 
it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright it's alright 
a stark naked light bulb hangs over my head there's one lonely pillow on my double bed
yeah i've got a ceiling a floor and four walls who says you can't have it all
my room's decorated with pictures of you
your letters wallpaper this shrine to the blues
i've got precious mem'ries at my beck and call oh who says you can't have it all
i've got everything a broken heart needs oh i'm doing fine don't you worry bout me
cause i'm lord and master of a fool's taj mahal oh who says you can't have it all
 steel  piano 
i've got everything a broken heart needs
oh who says you can't have it all 
we were sitting 'round the table
at the tuesday poker game
solvin' all the problems of the world
tryin' to draw an inside straight
and jimmy posed the question
as he played a pair of kings
if you could be anyone in this whole world
who would you be
would you be elvis shaking up memphis
making all the young girls scream
would you make a speech that would change the world
like martin luther king
go down in history like abe lincoln
cause you set a country free
if you could be anyone in this whole world
tell me who would you be
hank said i'd be a cowboy
someone like john wayne
johnny said hey pilgram
blow that cigar smoke the other way
said he'd make a million dollars
pitchin in the major leagues
then he stared straight into paul's bloodshot eyes
and said who would you be
would you be john lennon can you imagine
giving hope with just a song
would you be the babe pointin' that bat
saying this ones going long
maybe moses partin' the waters
saying children follow me
if you could be anyone in this whole world
tell me who would you be
i knew those boys 
would roll their eyes
when they heard what i had to say
but i shuffled the cards 
and said deuces wild 
and i told them anyways
i'd be a father who had all the answers 
to every question my kids had
i'd earn every word on that coffee cup 
that said world's greatest dad
be a perfect husband to that woman 
who means everything to me
if i could be anyone in this whole world
that's who i'd be
yeah that's who i'd be 
sunny days seem to hurt the most
i wear the pain like a heavy coat
i feel you everywhere i go
i see your smile i see your face
i hear you laughin' in the rain
i still can't believe you're gone
it ain't fair you died too young
like the story that had just begun
but death tore the pages all away
god knows how i miss you
all the hell that i've been through
just knowin' noone could take your place
sometimes i wonder who you'd be today 
would you see the world would you chase your dreams
settle down with a family
i wonder what would you name your babies
some days the sky's so blue
i feel like i can talk to you
an' i know it might sound crazy
it ain't fair you died too young
like the story that had just begun
but death tore the pages all away
god knows how i miss you
all the hell that i've been through
just knowin' noone could take your place
an' sometimes i wonder
who you'd be today
today today today
today today today
sunny days seem to hurt the most
i wear the pain like a heavy coat
the only thing that gives me hope
is i know i'll see you again some day
some day some day some day 
everywhere you look
you can write a book
on the trouble of a woman and a man
but you can not impose
you can't stick your nose
into something that you don't understand
but still you wonder
who's cheatin' who
who's being true
and who don't even care anymore
it makes you wonder
who's doin' right with someone tonight
and who's car is parked next door
i thought i knew her well
i really couldn't tell
that she had another lover on her mind
you see it felt so right
when she held me tight
how could i be so blind
but still you wonder
who's cheatin' who
who's being true
and who don't even care anymore
it makes you wonder
who's doin' right with someone tonight
who's car is parked next door
a heart is on the line
each and every time
love is stolen in the shadows of the night
though it's wrong all along
it keeps goin' on
as long as you keep in outta sight
still you wonder
who's cheatin' who
and who's being true
who don't even care anymore
it makes you wonder
who's doin' right with someone tonight
who's car is parked next door
still you wonder
who's cheatin' who
and who's being true
and who don't even care anymore
it makes you wonder
who's doin' right with someone tonight
who's car is parked next door
still you wonder
who's cheatin' who
and who's being true
and who don't even care anymore
it makes you wonder
who's doin' right with someone tonight
who's car is parked next door 
turn left at the old hotel
i know this boulevard much too well
it hasn't changed since i've been gone
oh this used to be my way home
they paved the road through the neighborhood
i guess the county finally fixed it good
it was gettin' rough
someone finally complained enough
fight the tears back with a smile
stop and look for a little while
oh it's plain to see the only thing missin' is me

that's my house and that's my car
that's my dog in my backyard
there's the window to the room
where she lays her pretty head
i planted that tree out by the fence
not long after we moved in
there's my kids and that's my wife
but who's that man runnin' my life
if i pulled in would it cause a scene
they're not really expecting me
those kids have been through hell
i hear they've adjusted well
turn around in the neighbor's drive
i'd be hard to recognize in this pickup truck
it's just an ol' fixer up
drive away one more time
a lot of things runnin' through my mind
i guess the less things change
the more they never seem the same

yeah 
who's that man who's that man runnin' my life
who's that man
who's that man who's that man runnin' my life
who's that man mmmhhhmmmm
who's that man who's that man runnin' my life
who's that man
who's that man

verse 1
well back in 1876 an old boy named bell
invented a contraption that we know so well
by the 1950's they're in everybody's home
it's a crazy little thing they call the telephone
now there's one on every corner
in the back of every bar
you can get one in your briefcase on a plane or in your car

so tell me why why
haven't i haven't i
heard from you why haven't i heard from you
tell me why why
haven't i haven't i
heard from you why haven't i heard from you
i said now darling honey
what is your excuse
why haven't i heard from you
verse 2
well there's no problem getting to me baby
you can dial direct
i got call forward and call waiting
you can even call collect
the service man he told me 
that my phone was working fine
and i've come to the conclusion the trouble isn't with my line 
i'm sure the operator would be glad to put you through
so dial zero for assistance if this all confuses you

so tell me why why
haven't i haven't i
heard from you why haven't i heard from you
tell me why why
haven't i haven't i
heard from you why haven't i heard from you
i said now darling honey
what is your excuse
why haven't i heard from you
bridge
there better been a flood a landslide of mud 
a fire that burns up the wires 
and thunder so loud with a black funnel cloud 
a natural disaster i know nothin' about

so tell me why why
haven't i haven't i
heard from you why haven't i heard from you
tell me why why
haven't i haven't i
heard from you why haven't i heard from you
i said now darling honey
what is your excuse
why haven't i heard from you
repeat 
why me lord what have i ever done
to deserve even one of the pleasures i've known
tell me lord what did i ever do
that was worth lovin' you or the kindness you've shown
lord help me jesus i've wasted it so
help me jesus i know what i am
but now that i know that i've needed you so
help me jesus my soul's in your hand
try me lord if you think there's a way
i can try to repay all i've taken from you
maybe lord i can show someone else
what i've been through myself on my way back to you
lord help me jesus i've wasted it so
help me jesus i know what i am
but now that i know that i've needed you so
help me jesus my soul's in your hand
lord help me jesus i've wasted it so
help me jesus i know what i am
but now that i know that i've needed you so
help me jesus my souls in your hand
jesus my soul's in your hand 


in this world there's a whole lot of trouble baby 
in this world there's a whole lot of pain 
in this world there's a whole lot of trouble but 
a whole lot of ground to gain 
why take when you could be giving 
why watch as the world goes by 
it's a hard enough life to be living 
why walk when you can fly 
in this world there's a whole lot of sorrow 
in this world there's a whole lot of shame 
in this world there's a whole lot of sorrow 
and a whole lot of ground to gain 
when you spend your whole life wishing 
wanting and wondering why 
it's a long enough life to be living 
why walk when you can fly 
and in this world there's a whole lot of golden 
in this world there's a whole lot of plain
in this world you've a soul for a compass 
and a heart for a pair of wings 
there's a star on the far horizon 
rising bright in an azure sky 
for the rest of the time that you're given 
why walk when you can fly 
it's 3 am and i finally say
i'm sorry for actin that way
i didn't really mean to make you cry
oh baby sometimes i wonder why

does it always have to come down to you leavin
before i'll say i love you
and why do i always use the words that cut the deepest
when i know how much it hurts you
oh baby why do i do that to you
well i know i'd never let you walk away
so why do i push you til you break
and why are you always on the verge of goodbye
before i'll show you how i really feel inside

why does it always have to come down to you leavin
before i'll say i love you
and why do i always use the words that cut the deepest
when i know how much it hurts you
oh baby why do i do that to you
why do i always use the words that cut the deepest
when i know how much it hurts you
oh baby why do i do that to you
why do i do that to you 
i am a lineman for the county 
and i drive the main roads
searching in the sun for another overload
i hear you singing in the wires 
i can hear you through the whine
and the wichita lineman 
is still on the line
i know i need a small vacation 
but it don't look like rain
and if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
and i need you more than want you 
and i want you for all time
and the wichita lineman 
is still on the line
and i need you more than want you 
and i want you for all time
and the wichita lineman 
is still on the line 
i am a lineman for the county

who doesn't know what i'm talking about
who's never left home who's never struck out
to find a dream and a life of their own
a place in the clouds a foundation of stone
many precede and many will follow
a young girl's dreams no longer hollow
it takes the shape of a place out west
but what it holds for her she hasn't yet guessed
she needs wide open spaces
room to make her big mistakes
she needs new faces
she knows the highest stakes
she traveled this road as a child
wideeyed and grinning she never tired
but now she won't be coming back with the rest
if these are life's lessons she'll take this test
she needs wide open spaces
room to make her big mistakes
she needs new faces
she knows the highest stakes
she knows the highest stakes
as her folks drive away her dad yells check the oil
mom stares out the window and says i'm leaving my girl
she said it didn't seem like athat long ago
when she stood there and let her own folks know 
she needed wide open spaces
room to make her big mistakes
she needs new faces
she knows the highest stakes
she knows the highest stakes
she knows the highest stakes
wide open spaces
she knows the highest stakes
she knows the highest stakes
wide open spaces 
from a phone booth in cheyenne
i made a promise to diane
no more rodeos
i'd gone my last go 'round
the same promise that i made
in san antone and santa fe
but tonight i saddled up
and let her down
wild horses keep draggin' me away
and i'll lose more than i'm gonna win someday
wild horses just stay wild
and her heart is all i break
wild horses keep draggin' me away
she'll watch me drive around her block
gettin' courage up to stop
to make her one more promise
that i can't keep
the way i love the rodeo
i guess i should let her go
before i hurt her more
than she loves me
wild horses keep draggin' me away
and i'll lose more than i'm gonna win someday
wild horses just stay wild
and her heart is all i break
wild horses keep draggin' me away 
i come here today i'm kind of nervous
you know how words get in my way
it should come easy i've been rehearsing
i don't know why i'm so afraid to say
will you marry me
put our love and life together
will you stay with me
for always and forever
on bended knee would you take this ring
will you marry me please
will you marry me
to be with you is what i live for
but at this moment i confess
though i love you god knows i love you
deep down inside i'm scared to death say yes
will you marry me
put our love and life together
will you stay with me
for always and forever
on bended knee would you take this ring
will you marry me please
will you marry me
on bended knee
on bended knee
would you take this ring
i will take your ring
will you marry me please
will you marry me 

baby look here at me
have you ever seen me this way
i've been fumblin' for words
through the tears and the hurt and the
pain
i'm gonna lay it all out
on the line tonight
and i think that it's time
to tell this uphill fight goodbye
have ever had to love someone
that just don't feel the same
tryin' to make somebody care for you
the way i do
is like tryin' to catch the rain
and if love is really forever
i'm a winner at a losin' game
i know that baby you tried
to find me somewhere inside of you
but you know you can't lie
girl you can't hide the truth
sometimes two hearts
just can't dance to the same beat
so i'll pack up my things
and i'll take what remains of me
have ever had to love someone
that just don't feel the same
tryin' to make somebody care for you
the way i do
is like tryin' to catch the rain
and if love is really forever
i'm a winner at a losin' game
i know that i'll never be the man that you need or love
yeah baby it's killin' me to stand here and see
i'm not what you've been dreamin' of
have ever had to love someone
that just don't feel the same
tryin' to make somebody care for you
the way i do
is like tryin' to catch the rain
and if love is really forever
i'm a winner at a losin' game
oh oh if love is really forever
i'm a winner at a losin' game
ooo i'm tired of losing
oh oh oh 
i've never ask you where you're goin'
i've never ask you where you've been
i've never called and checked your story
you stayed out with all your freinds
i've never tried to catch you lyin'
i didn't want to know the truth
i'd rather go on lovin' blind girl
than go on lovin' without you
i wish i didn't know now what i didn't know then
i wish i could start this whole thing over again
i'm not sayin' it's you could never be true 
i just don't wanna know how it ends
you'd still have my heart in the palm of your hands
i'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
yeah i wish somehow i didn't know now what i didn't know then
i've always said what i don't know
couldn't hurt as bad as leavin' you
turns out i knew what i was thinkin'
it ain't an easy thing to do
well i guess i should be goin'
i sure found out too much to stay
please don't say your sorry
i might wait another day
i wish i didn't know now what i didn't know then
i wish i could start this whole thing over again
i'm not sayin' it's you could never be true
i just don't wanna know how it ends
you'd still have my heart in the palm of your hands
i'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
yeah i wish somehow i didn't know now what i didn't know then
you'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
i'd still look like a fool in front of your freinds
yeah i wish somehow i didn't know now what i didn't know then
yeah i wish somehow i didn't know now what i didn't know then 

they say don't go on wolverton mountain if you're looking for a wife
cause clifton clovers has a pretty young daughter
he's mighty handy with a gun and a knife
her tender lips are sweeter than honey and wolverton mountain protects her there
the bears and the birds tell clifton clovers if a stranger should enter there
all of my dreams are on wolverton mountain i want his daughter for my wife
i'll take my chances and climb that mountain
though clifton clovers he might take my life
her tender lips are sweeter than honey
i'm going up on wolverton mountain it's too lonesome down here below
it's just not right to hide his daughter from the one who loves her so
her tender lips are sweeter than honey
and i don't care about clifron clovers i'm gonna climb up on his mountain
i'm gonna take the girl i love i don't care about clifron clovers
i'm gonna climb up on that mountain and i'll get the one i love 
january's always bitter
but lord this one beats all
the wind ain't quit for weeks now
and the drifts are ten feet tall
i been all night drivin' heifers
closer in to lower ground
then i spent the mornin' thinkin'
'bout the ones the wolves pulled down
charlie barton and his family
stopped today to say goodbye
he said the bank was takin' over
the last few years were just too dry
and i promised that i'd visit
when they found a place in town
then i spent a long time thinkin'
'bout the ones the wolves pulled down
bridge
lord please shine a light of hope
on those of us who fall behind
and when we stumble in the snow
could you help us up while there's still time
well i don't mean to be complainin' lord
you've always seen me through
and i know you got your reasons
for each and every thing you do
but tonight outside my window
there's a lonesome mournful sound
and i just can't keep from thinkin'
'bout the ones the wolves pulled down
oh lord keep me from bein'
the one the wolves pull down 
i'm not always strong
and sometimes i'm even wrong
but i win when i choose
and i can't stand to lose
but i can't always be 
the rock that you see
when the nights get too long
and i just can't go on
the woman in me
needs you to be
the man in my arms
to hold tenderly
cause i'm a woman in love
and it's you i run to
yeah the woman in me
needs the man in you
when the world wants too much
and it feels cold and out of touch
it's a beautiful place
when you kiss my face
the woman in me
needs you to be
the man in my arms
to hold tenderly
cause i'm a woman in love
and it's you i run to
yeah the woman in me
needs the man in you
yeah the woman in me
needs the man in you 
i'm not always strong
and sometimes i'm even wrong
but i win when i choose
and i can't stand to lose
but i can't always be 
the rock that you see
when the nights get too long
and i just can't go on
the woman in me
needs you to be
the man in my arms
to hold tenderly
cause i'm a woman in love
and it's you i run to
yeah the woman in me
needs the man in you
when the world wants too much
and it feels cold and out of touch
it's a beautiful place
when you kiss my face

needs you to be
the man in my arms
to hold tenderly
cause i'm a woman in love
and it's you i run to
yeah the woman in me
needs the man in you
yeah the woman in me
needs the man in you 
a callused right hand
holds a shiny gold watch
for thirty years spent on the clock
but you won't see no tears
from this workin' class hero
he's always been hard as a rock
but he knows he's too old
to really start over
besides he just wouldn't know how
i guess he's just glad
that he's not alone
but he's got to wonder what now
'cause there's no hall of fame for that working class hero
no statute carved out of stone
and his greatest reward is the love of a woman
and his children
so after he's gone
that old working class hero lives on
that threebedroom house
he built in the '50s
seems so much bigger today
with just him and mama
and not many bills
'cause all of the kids moved away
what he's done with his life
might not be remembered
but he's got every right to be proud
'cause the blood sweatin' years
of this workin' class hero
is really what livin's about
'cause there's no hall of fame for that working class hero
no statute carved out of stone
and his greatest reward is the love of a woman
and his children
so after he's gone
that old workin' class hero lives on
yes that workin' class hero lives on
that workin' class hero lives on 
you get up every morning 'fore the sun comes up
toss a lunchbox into a pickup truck
a long hard day sure ain't much fun
but you've gotta get it started if you wanna get it done
you set your mind and roll up your sleeves
you're workin' on a working man's phd
with your heart in your hands and the sweat on your brow
you build the things that really make the world go around
if it works if it runs if it lasts for years
you bet your bottom dollar it was made right here
with pride honor and dignity
from a man with a working man's phd
now there ain't no shame in a job well done
from driving a nail to driving a truck
as a matter of fact i'd like to set things straight
a few more people should be pullin' their weight
if you wanna cram course in reality
you get yourself a working man's phd
when the quittin' whistle blows and the dust settles down
there ain't no trophies or cheering crowds
you'll face yourself at the end of the day
and be damn proud of whatever you've made
can't hang it on the wall for the world to see
but you've got yourself a working man's phd
now there ain't no shame in a job well done
from driving a nail to driving a truck
as a matter of fact i'd like to set things straight
a few more people should be pullin' their weight
if you wanna cram course in reality
you get yourself a working man's phd 
to the teller down at the bank
you're just another checking account
to the plumber that came today
you're just another house
at the airport ticket counter
you're just another fare
at the beauty shop at the mall
well you're just another head of hair
well that's alright that's ok
if you don't feel important honey
all i've got to say is

to the world
you may be just another girl
but to me 
baby you are the world
to the waiter at the restaurant
you're just another tip
to the guy at the ice cream shop
you're just another dip
when you can't get reservations
'cause you don't have the clout
or you didn't get an invitation
'cause somebody left you out
that's alright that's ok
when you don't feel important honey
all i've got to say is

you think you're one of millions but you're one in a million to me
when you wonder if you matter baby look into my eyes
and tell me can't you see you're everything to me
that's alright that's ok
when you don't feel important honey
all i've gotta say is
 
would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire
would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher
if we roll from town to town and never shut it down
would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover
would we walk even closer until the trip was over
and would it be okay if i didn't know the way
if i gave you my hand would you take it
and make me the happiest man in the world
if i told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you girl
would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
let me know if you're really a dream
i love you so so would you go with me
would you go with me if we rode the clouds together
could you not look down forever
if you were lighter than a feather
oh and if i set you free would you go with me
if i gave you my hand would you take it
and make me the happiest man in the world
if i told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you girl
would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
help me tie up the ends of a dream
i gotta know would you go with me
i love you so so would you go with me 
i didn't have to turn my head whenever you walked in
the only one to let these chills roll down my skin
my heart beats faster i hear your name
i feel my confidence slippin' away

i thought i was doin' fine
'bout to get you off my mind
i see your face and then i'm
wrapped around your pretty little finger again
it feels like ages since you laid down in my arms
i see no good reason but still i'm tangled in your charms
my god you're smilin' and you catch my eye
my heart is pounding deep inside

ain't gonna let no man go down without a fight
'cause my stalls and walls look better in the bright day light
my heart beats faster i call your name
i feel my confidence slippin' away

your pretty little finger
baby i'm wrapped around your pretty little finger
pretty little finger 
i know your leavin
i see the signs
youre gonna walk out on this heart of mine

we made it you and i 

you're on the phone 
with your girlfriend she's upset
she's going off about
something that you said
'cause she doesn't
get your humor like i do
i'm in the room
it's a typical tuesday night
i'm listening to the kind of
music she doesn't like
and she'll never
know your story like i do
but she wears short skirts
i wear tshirts
she's cheer captain
and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming 'bout the day
when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for
has been here the whole time
if you could see that
i'm the one who understands you
been here all along
so why can't you see
you belong with me
you belong with me
walk in the streets
with you and your worn out jeans
i can't helping thinking
this is how it ought to be
laughing on a park bench
thinking to myself
hey isn't this easy
and you've got a smile
that could light up this whole town
i haven't seen it in a while
since she brought you down
you say you're fine
i know you better than that
hey whatcha doing
with a girl like that
she wears high heels
i wear sneakers
she's cheer captain
and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming 'bout the day
when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for
has been here the whole time
if you could see that
i'm the one who understands you
been here all along
so why can't you see
you belong with me
standing by you
waiting at your back door
all this time
how could you not know baby
you belong with me
you belong with me
oh i remember you driving to my house
in the middle of the night
i'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're about to cry
i know your favorite songs
and you tell me about your dreams
think i know where you belong
think i know it's with me
can't you see that
i'm the one who understands you
been here all along
so why can't you see
you belong with me
standing by you
waiting at your back door
all this time
how could you not know baby
you belong with me
you belong with me
you belong with me
have you ever thought just maybe
you belong with me
you belong with me 
i know it ain't none of my business
when it comes to the affairs of your heart
it's really hard for me to say this
but your trouble's gettin' ready to start
well i've heard you say how much you love him
you think someday you'll be his bride
baby you just can't trust him
'cause i've known the boy all of my life

so you better think twice before you roll the dice
you better think twice before you give your heart away
you really must think i'm something
talkin' trash about me best friend
i just hate to see you wind up with nothing
'cause you're way too good for him
and i know that you don't believe me
but i've been with him when he's runnin' 'round
he don't mean to hurt nobody
he ain't never gonna settle down

you better think twice
you better think twice
you better think twice
you better think twice 
wind blowin' on my face
sidewalk flyin' beneath my bike
a five yearold's first taste
of what freedom's really like
he was runnin' right beside me
his hand holdin' on the seat
i took a deep breath and hollered
as i headed for the street
you can let go now daddy
you can let go
oh i think i'm ready
to do this on my own
it's still a little bit scary
but i want you to know
i'll be ok now daddy
you can let go
i was standin' at the altar
between the two loves of my life
to one i've been a daughter
to one i soon would be a wife
when the preacher asked
ëwho gives this woman'
daddy's eyes filled up with tears
he kept holdin' tightly to my arm
ëtill i whispered in his ear
you can let go now daddy
you can let go
oh i think i'm ready
to do this on my own
it still feels a little bit scary
but i want you to know
i'll be ok now daddy
you can let go
it was killin' me to see
the strongest man i ever knew
wastin' away to nothin'
in that hospital room
ëyou know he's only hangin' on for you'
that's what the night nurse said
my voice and heart were breakin'
as i crawled up in his bed and said
you can let go now daddy
you can let go
your little girl is ready
to do this on my own
it's gonna be a little bit scary
but i want you to know
i'll be ok now daddy
you can let go
you can let go 
you say you're heart's been broken
and you just can't win
you say that you'll never find love again
let me tell you friend

you can't give up on love
that's the one thing we've got to keep going
cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
but you can't give up on love
looked out my window and what did i see
it's another broken family
the kids are stayin' with mama at home
daddy's livin in a house all alone

you can't give up on love
that's the one thing we've got to keep going
cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
but you can't give up on love
troubled times make it hard to stay
so many lovers take the easy way
but don't go crazy and jump ship too soon
cause everday can't be a honeymoon

you can't give up on love
that's the one thing we've got to keep going
cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
but you can't give up on love
no you can't give up on love
oh you can't give up on love 
all my life was a paper once plain pure and white
till you moved with your pen changin' moods now and then
till the balance was right
then you added some music ev'ry note was in place
and anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face
and you decorated my life created a world where dreams are a part
and you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
you decorated my life
like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
there was no harmony life meant nothin' to me until you came along
and you brought out the colors what a gentle surprise
now i'm able to see all the things life can be shinin' soft in your eyes
and you decorated my life created a world where dreams are a part
and you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
you decorated my life 
all my life was a paper once plain pure and white
till you moved with your pen changin' moods now and then
till the balance was right
then you added some music ev'ry note was in place
and anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face
and you decorated my life created a world where dreams are a part
and you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
you decorated my life
like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
there was no harmony life meant nothin' to me until you came along
and you brought out the colors what a gentle surprise
now i'm able to see all the things life can be shinin' soft in your eyes
and you decorated my life created a world where dreams are a part
and you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
you decorated my life 

hey hey sweet darling
let's go dancing tonight
my clock has been ticking
it tell me the timing's just right
well i woke up this morning
with a feeling i call lonesome and blue
and there's no need in asking  'cause i know
you feel the same way too
hey hey sweet darling
let's lay the whole thing down
this world if you let it
will drive you into the ground
i got twenty dollars and i know
that it should get us by the door
when the band starts playing
how can they ask us for more
we may do the bump and grind
shake around our little behinds
do some things that you normally do
on a saturday night  and that's all right
we may drink a little too much
we may lose our fancy touch
and step outta line with reality
that's the way it should be
and there's no need in asking  'cause i know
you feel the same way too
hey hey sweet darling
a lot of words have been unkind
but that was yesterday
why don't we leave the past behind
you know that i love you
you know that'll always be true
and there's no need in asking  'cause i know
you feel the same way i do 


can i have this dance my you're looking pretty 
is there something wrong did he leave you hurting 
i don't mean to pry but that tear in your eye gave you away 
if you don't want to talk we'll keep it quiet 
but sometimes a heartache hurts worse if you hide it 
i think there's a chance one slow dance might ease the pain 
you have the right to remain silent 
anything that you say as i hold you against me 
will forever be a secret between us two 
i've been wanting you but you didn't know it 
and now that he's gone at last i can show it 
if your heart is tired for the rest of your life 
lay your love on me 
so many times my eyes have held you 
tonight please give my arms that chance 
if you don't feel the need for conversation 
we'll just let our hearts talk while we dance 
you have the right to remain silent 
anything that you say as i hold you against me 
will forever be a secret between us two 
i've been wanting you but you didn't know it 
and now that he's gone at last i can show it 
if your heart is tired for the rest of your life 
lay your love on me 
if your heart is tired for the rest of your life 
lay your love on me 
when you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
and whispered in my ear guess who
i rattled off names like i really didn't know
but all along i knew it was you
and the longer we talked the more we laughed
and wondered why we didn't last
it had been a long time but later last night
baby we caught up real fast
and maybe it's a little too early
to know if this is gonna work
all i know is you're sure looking
good in my shirt
that's right
you look good in my shirt
well now i'm not saying that we solved overnight
every way that we went wrong
oh but what i'm seeing i'd sure love seeing
every morning from now on
and maybe it's a little too early
to know if this is gonna work
all i know is you're sure looking
good in my shirt
c'mon now
aww that's right
oh you look so fine
and maybe it's a little too early
to know if this is gonna work
all i know is you're sure looking
good in my shirt
and maybe it's a little too early
to know if this is gonna work
all i know is you're sure looking
good in my shirt
you look good in my shirt
you look good in my shirt 
i cried a tear you wiped it dry
i was confused you cleared my mind
i sold my soul you bought it back for me
and held me up and gave me dignity
somehow you needed me
you gave me strength to stand alone again
to face the world out on my own again
you put me high upon a pedestal
so high that i could almost see eternity
you needed me you needed me
and i can't believe it's you i can't believe it's true
i needed you and you were there
and i'll never leave why should i leave i'd be a fool 
'cause i finally found someone who really cares
you held my hand when it was cold
when i was lost you took me home
you gave me hope when i was at the end
and turned my lies back into truth again
you even called me friend
you gave me strength to stand alone again
to face the world out on my own again
you put me high upon a pedestal
so high that i could almost see eternity
you needed me you needed me
you needed me you needed me 
every now and then i get a little lost
my strings all get tangled my wires all get crossed
every now and then i'm right up on the edge
dangling my toes out over the ledge
i just thank god you're here
'cause when i'm a bullet shot out of a gun
'cause when i'm a firecracker comin' undone
or when i'm a fugitive ready to run all wildeyed and crazy
no matter where my reckless soul takes me
baby you save me
it's hard lovin' a man that's got a gypsy soul
i don't know how you do it i'm not sure how you know
the perfect thing to say to save me from myself
you're the angel that believes in me like nobody else
and i thank god you do
'cause when i'm a bullet shot out of a gun
when i'm a firecracker comin' undone
when i'm a fugitive ready to run all wildeyed and crazy
no matter where my reckless soul takes me
baby you save me
well i know i don't tell you nearly enough
that i couldn't live one day without your love
when i'm a ship tossed around on the waves
up on a high wire that's ready to break
when i've had just about all i can take
baby you baby you save me
when i'm a bullet shot out of a gun
when i'm a firecracker coming undone
when i'm a fugitive ready to run all wildeyed and crazy
no matter where my reckless soul takes me
baby you save me 
if i closed my eyes it didn't hurt quite so bad
'cause tonight i've just lost the best friend i've ever had
you were a maverick running all away from new orleans
we'd tell stories 'round the campfire late at night
when it was down to just you and me
good friend why did you have to go
just when i was getting to know you

you were a good friend
they don't make 'em quite like you
and in my memory

said i'm going home boy
my work is done
i can feel it in my bones
good friend why did you have to go
just when i was getting to know you
i'll sing this song to show
you were a good friend
they don't make 'em quite like you
and in my memory
you'll always be a good good friend to me 
i'm lookin' for a lover

hope is an anchor and love is a ship time is the ocean and life is a trip
you don't know where you're going ëtill you know where you're at
and if you can't read the stars well you better have a map
a compass and a conscience so you don't get lost at sea
or on some lonely island where no one wants to be
from the beginning of creation i think our maker had a plan
for us to leave these shores and sail beyond the sand
and let the good light guide us through the waves and the wind
to the beaches in a world where we have never been
and we'll climb up on a mountain y'all we'll let our voices ring
those who've never tried it they'll be the first to sing
whoa my my
i'll see you on the other side
if i make it
and it might be a long hard ride
but i'm wanna take it
sometimes it seems that i don't have a prayer
let the weather take me anywhere
but i know that i wanna go
where the streets are gold 
ëcause you'll be there
oh my  my
you don't bring nothing with you here
and you can't take nothing back
i ain't never seen a hearse with a luggage rack
so i've torn my knees up prayin'
scarred my back from fallin' down
spent so much time flying high till i'm face first in the ground
so if you're up there watchin' me would you talk to god and say
tell him i might need a hand to see you both someday
whoa my my
so i'll see you on the other side
if i make it
and it might be a long hard ride
but i'm wanna take it
sometimes it seems that i don't have a prayer
let the weather take me anywhere
but i know that i wanna go
where the streets are gold 
ëcause you'll be there
oh my  my
cause you'll be there
oh my my 
kix brooksronnie dunndon cook
i'm still hurtin' from the last time
you walked on this heart of mine
i can't find much to believe in
you let me down so many times
heaven knows how i love you
but i'm tired of holding on
you better kiss me
'cause your gonna miss me when i'm gone
not much chance we're gonna make it
if i'm the only one who's trying
you know i'm running out of reasons
and we're running out of time
someday girl you're gonna wake up
and wonder what went wrong
you better kiss me
'cause your gonna miss me when i'm gone
you're good at going through the motions
all i hear are alibis
not i get this empty feeling
when i look into your eyes
i don't see a love light shining
i don't know what's going on 
you better kiss me
'cause your gonna miss me when i'm gone
you better kiss me
'cause your gonna miss me when i'm gone
you better kiss me
'cause your gonna miss me when i'm gone 
she was staring out the window of that suv
complaining saying i can't wait to turn 18

before she knows it she's a brand new bride
in her one bedroom apartment and her daddy stops by
he tells her it's a nice place she says it'll do for now
starts talking about babies and buying a house
and daddy shakes his head and says baby just slow down
'cause you're gonna miss this

you're gonna wish these days 
hadn't gone by so fast
these are some good times 
so take a good look around

yet it seems to me not too long ago you didn't care
the love you left
no longer lives
within my heart
see the game you played
so recklessly
tore it all apart
and you're the one
you're the one
that made me cry
oh you're the one
that laughed at me
then said goodbye

that made me blue
so how's it feel

in everything that i could be
i've gotta sayyou really got a way
you've got a way it seems
you gave me faith to find my dreams
you'll never know just what that means
can't you see you got a way with me
it's in the way you want me
it's in the way you hold me
the way you show me just what love's made of
it's in the way we make love
you've got a way with words
you get me smiling even when it hurts
there's no way to measure what your love is worth
i can't believe the way you get through to me
it's in the way you want me
it's in the way you hold me
the way you show me just what love's made of
it's in the way we make love
oh how i adore you
like no one before you
i love you just the way you are
it's in the way you want me
it's in the way you hold me
the way you show me just what love's made of
it's in the way we make love
it's just the way you are 
your cheatin' heart
will make you weep
you'll cry and cry
and try to sleep
but sleep won't come
the whole night through
your cheatin' heart will tell on you
when tears come down
like falling rain
you'll toss around
and call my name
you'll walk the floor
the way i do
your cheatin' heart will tell on you
your cheatin' heart 
will pine some day
and crave the love
you threw away
the time will come
when you'll be blue
your cheatin' heart will tell on you
when tears come down
like falling rain
you'll toss around
and call my name
you'll walk the floor
the way i do
your cheatin' heart will tell on you 
i've seen the seven wonders of the world
i've seen the beauty of diamonds and pearls
but they ain't nothin baby
your love amazes me
i've seen a sunset that would make you cry
and colors of a rainbow reachin cross the sky
the moon in all its phases but
your love amazes me

don't you ever doubt this love of mine
you're the only one for me
you give me hope you give me reason
you give me somethin to believe in
forever faithfully
your love amazes me
i've prayed for miracles that never came
got down on my knees out in the pourin rain
but only you could save me
your love amazes me
 
it's not the flowers
wrapped in fancy paper
it's not the ring
i wear around my finger
there's nothing in all the world i need
when i have you here beside me
here beside me

so you could give me wings to fly
and catch me if i fall
or pull the stars down from the sky
so i could wish on them all
but i couldn't ask for more
'cause your love is the greatest gift of all
in your arms
i found a strength inside of me
and in your eyes
there's a light to guide me
i would be lost without you
and all that my heart could ever want
has come true

bridge
you could offer me the sun the moon
and i would still believe
you gave me everything
when you gave your heart to me
piano solo
i couldn't ask for more
'cause your love is the greatest gift of all
