I'll Hold You In My Arms (1947)
I値l hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Like you致e never been held before
I値l think of each day and then I値l dream the night away
Till you are in my arms once more

The stars up in the sky know the reason why
I feel so blue when I知 away from you
I値l hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
So darling, please wait for me
